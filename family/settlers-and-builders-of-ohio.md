The [Settlers and Builders of Ohio](https://www.ogs.org/about/lineage/sbo/)
lineage society, under the [Ohio Genealogical Society](https://www.ogs.org/)
(OGS), recognizes the descendants of pioneers who contributed to the development
and growth of Ohio from its earliest days.  Membership in this society honors
the lasting legacy of Ohio's early settlers, acknowledging their pivotal role in
shaping the state's history during a time of significant expansion and
development in the mid-19th century.

### William Rees and Eunice Marcella Burch

[William Rees](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rees-4587), born in 1834, and
[Eunice Marcella Burch](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Burch-6263), born in 1855,
represent the strong roots of Ohio's pioneering spirit. Their lives in Ohio
during a period marked by rapid growth, agricultural development, and community
building exemplify the resilience and determination that were necessary to build
the state's early communities. Through descent from these ancestors, their story
continues to resonate with their descendants today, offering a window into
Ohio's rich historical tapestry as it transitioned from a frontier region to a
thriving state.

### Challenges in Documentation

Documenting the lives of William Rees and Eunice Marcella Burch presented unique
challenges due to the existence of a nearly identically named couple living in
New Jersey during the same period. This similarity led to considerable
difficulties in distinguishing between records belonging to the Ohio settlers
and those of the New Jersey couple. Through careful research and
cross-referencing, their correct lineage and Ohio residency were confirmed,
ensuring that their true legacy is preserved. The meticulous effort required to
separate these two families highlights the complexities often faced in
genealogical research.
