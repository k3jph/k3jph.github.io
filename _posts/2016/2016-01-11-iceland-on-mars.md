Last summer, when I spoke at the [Mars Society Convention](https://jameshoward.us/2015/09/14/planning-for-martian-polity-now-on-youtube), I used Iceland as one of three comparison points for the expected evolution of self-governance on Mars.  Today, the Mars Society posted an older link about a 2014 conference on establishing a [bill of rights for Mars](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140709-why-mars-needs-a-bill-of-rights):

>  [Iceland] is in a relatively isolated location with a low population. And, as on Mars, inhabitants also face a unique set of natural challenges, in fact parts of Iceland even look like an alien world.

Those are important, and I acknowledged those reasons, though Mars is far less hospitable than Iceland.  Still, the results are interesting, including this:

> Delegates also agree that the “right to leave” should be included in the new constitution. 

Because of how impractical that is at Mars, vis-a-vis, for instance, the Moon, my research has split the governance strategies depending on whether getting back to Earth is easy (Moon and LEO), hard (Mars), or impossible (a generation ship).
