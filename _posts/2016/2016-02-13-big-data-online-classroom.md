I am taking an online class in how to teach online classes.  This is a bit meta and I've taught online since 2010, but that's okay.  We have a group project in the class to write a presentation and my group is on [big data](/scholarship).  There was one other person in my group and she dropped out of the class a few days ago, so I am kind of on my own.  I wrote my presentation called "Big Data in the Online Classroom" and thought I'd share it here.
