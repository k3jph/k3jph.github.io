I have another review in the _[Journal of Statistical Software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/)_ on the book _Meta-Analysis with R_.  From the review,

> Meta-analysis is a set of analytical tools that allows us to collect multiple different results into what can be thought of as a weighted average of the individual studiesâ€™ results.

The book provides a solid introduction to meta-analysis using R.  You can read the whole review at [JSS](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v070b01) and purchase the book on [Amazon here](http://www.amazon.com/dp/3319214152).
