There's a great article by Jenna Tyler at IUPUI (who doesn't have a website?) on how to use green infrastructure for sustainable mitigation.  The key take away is that FEMA could use smarter funding for hazard mitigation, and create naturally resilient mitigation options.  You can read it in [the current issue of _Consilience_](http://www.consiliencejournal.org/index.php/consilience/article/viewPDFInterstitial/458/279).
