I recently happened upon a cache of old syllabi [for my math courses
going to back to the](/teaching) fall of 2014. As these syllabi are
centrally developed (more or less) by the course chairs, they
generally reflect the state of the course at UMGC/UMUC during each
semester. Included here are 15 new syllabi including for courses
that I have not posted before:

*   MATH 108 Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry
*   MATH 115 Pre-Calculus
*   MATH 140 Calculus I

Also, while I was at it, I posted my syllabus for this summer's
[research methods course at Penn State](/teaching/).
