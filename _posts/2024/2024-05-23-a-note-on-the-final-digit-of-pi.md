I recently saw someone wearing a t-shirt that said, "My password is the
last 8 digits of $\pi$." The joke, of course, lies in the fact that
$\pi$ (pi) is an irrational number, meaning its decimal expansion goes
on forever without repeating. Consequently, there are no "last" digits
to know. However, a fascinating twist exists when considering $\pi$ in
binary form.

This elegant and humorous observation underlines the intriguing
properties of irrational numbers and their representations in different
numeral systems.

The joke about the t-shirt cleverly plays on our understanding of
infinity and irrational numbers. While it's true that we cannot specify
the "last" digits of $\pi$ in decimal form, the binary perspective offers a
unique insight.

For those who love diving deeper into mathematics, exploring the
properties of $\pi$ across different bases can be a delightful exercise. It
enriches our appreciation of mathematical beauty and provides a fun way
to engage with infinity and number theory concepts.
