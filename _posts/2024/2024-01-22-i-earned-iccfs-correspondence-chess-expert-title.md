The road to this achievement has been both challenging and rewarding.
Correspondence chess, for those unfamiliar, differs from traditional
chess in that players have days, sometimes even weeks, to make a
single move. This format requires a deep strategic understanding,
patience, and an analytical mindset that challenges even the most
seasoned players.

Earning a norm in correspondence chess is no small feat. It involves
competing in high-level tournaments and achieving results that
surpass standard expectations against other skilled players from
around the world. To earn the title of Correspondence Chess Expert,
[a player must accumulate multiple such norms, demonstrating
consistent performance across several
events](https://www.welshccf.org.uk/article/174).

My journey involved countless hours of studying chess openings,
middlegame tactics, and endgame strategies. But beyond the technical
skills, correspondence chess has taught me the art of patience and
the importance of meticulous planning. Each move is a decision that
could take weeks of consideration, relying heavily on thorough
analysis and future forecasting.

The use of chess engines is permitted in correspondence chess, but
this adds an extra layer of strategy rather than detracting from
the skill of the game. Players must not only understand the best
theoretical moves but also need to move deeper into understanding
why each move is considered strong, and how to counteract sophisticated
computer-generated strategies.

With the title of Correspondence Chess Expert now under my belt,
my sights are set on further achievements. The next goal is achieving
the title of Correspondence Chess Master. Knowing the hard work and
dedication it takes to reach even this point, I am more motivated
than ever to continue my growth and contribute to this beautiful,
intellectual sport.

limits, expands your horizons, and connects you deeply with others
