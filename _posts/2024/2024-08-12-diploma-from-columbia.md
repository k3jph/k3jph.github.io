I am excited to finally share that I have graduated from Columbia University
with a master's in electrical engineering. It feels surreal to hold my diploma
in hand, and I wanted to take a moment to look back at the ride it has been.

Over the past few years, I have tackled a bunch of different courses that
stretched my brain in all sorts of directions. From Solid Biomechanics to Future
Energy Systems, it has been a mix of fascinating subjects that have kept me on
my toes. Some of these classes were tough nuts to crack, while others were a
breeze&mdash;I am looking at you, Blockchain Technology.

One of the coolest things I did was in my Optical Systems course, where I built
a virtual model of the [LORRI
camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Reconnaissance_Imager)&mdash;the
one used on the _[New Horizons](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/new-horizons/)_
and other spacecraft. It was pretty awesome to dive into the optics and
mechanics of a real-world system thatâ€™s been used in space exploration. That
project was definitely a highlight of my time at Columbia and something I am
really proud of.

In Quantitative Physiology II and Computational Modeling of Physiological
Systems, I got to blend engineering with biology in a really hands-on way. I
built a [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/) model to take measurements on a
sonogram, which was both challenging and super rewarding. It was one of those
projects that reminded me just how versatile and impactful engineering can be.

Now that I am done, I am excited to see where this knowledge will take me next.
Whether I am working on the next big thing in energy or just tinkering with new
ideas, I am ready for whatever comes my way.

Thanks to everyone who has been there for me during this adventure.
