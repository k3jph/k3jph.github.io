I am taking a course in heraldry and one of the assignments in the course
is to take a local examples of civic,
corporate, and ecclesiastical arms, and blazon them and then describe 
the symbolry.  Of course, this assignment assumes you are in Great Britain
where coats of arms are commonly used.  I live in the United States.
But I also live in Maryland...

Living in Maryland, far from the shores of England, one might not
expect to encounter much English tradition.  But Maryland 
sometimes has trouble distancing itself from some of the ancient 
English traditions. 

Our state flag, derived from the arms of [Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron
Baltimore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Calvert,_2nd_Baron_Baltimore), 
serves as a vibrant testament to this enduring legacy.
Unlike most American states, Maryland goes a step further by consistently
incorporating coats of arms into the seals of its institutions,
blending old-world symbolism with modern identity.

</div>

This is all to say that as Marylanders, we will happily die on any
hill over our state's flag.  It means more to us than the flag of
the United States, and we claim ownership over that, too (our
national anthem, [was written about it in Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Scott_Key)).  
And the examples
will all alude to the Maryland flag, in different ways.  It is, to
put it bluntly, the way we roll.

## Civic Heraldry: Montgomery County

[Montgomery County](https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/) presents a unique instance within Maryland's
landscape, boasting a civic coat of arms that stands distinct from
its official seal:

> Quarterly, per fess embattled: 1st and 4th, Azure, a fleur-de-lis Or; 2nd and 3rd, Gules, a ring Or, stoned Azure.

<div class="row">

   alt="The Seal of Montgomery County" cap="The Seal of Montgomery County" %}
</div>

Montgomery County was named for Richard Montgomery.  Accordingly,
the arms are a reference to him.  They include the fleur-de-lis and
the ring, both used on Richard Montgomery's coat of arms. But they are organized differently.
Instead, the arms are quartered to present these charged, as a
subtle nod to the Maryland coat of arms.  Also, like with the State
of Maryland, Montgomery County uses these arms for its flag.  Another
interesting aspect is the embattling of the fess division.  I have
seen this described as being about the jagged lines of county
boundaries.  But I think, instead, this is due to Richard Montgomery's
position as a soldier and general.

Interestingly, the arms find their primary manifestation not in
traditional uses but through modern adaptations, like the county's
seals, which vary in design for different purposes, demonstrating
the flexibility of heraldic traditions in public symbolism.

## Corporate Heraldry: Johns Hopkins University

[The Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu), situated in Baltimore, incorporates
heraldic traditions into its identity, linking itself both to the
state and to its educational mission:

> Quarterly: 1st and 4th, Paly Or and Sable, a bend counterchanged; 2nd and 3rd, 
> quarterly argent and gules, a cross bottony counterchanged; over all an armillary 
> sphere Or between two books Argent on a chief Azure.

   alt="The Logo of the Johns Hopkins University" cap="The Logo of the Johns Hopkins University" %}
</div>

The university's seal features the Lord Baltimore's arms, untouched,
but adds symbols of learning and science to signify its purpose and
aspirations. While the seal remains important for formal occasions
like diplomas, the university has also adopted a more simplified
emblem for everyday use, showcasing the adaptability of heraldic
symbols in a digital age.

## Ecclesiastical Heraldry: The Archdiocese of Baltimore

The [Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore](https://www.archbalt.org/)'s 
arms offer a distinct interpretation of heraldic traditions, reflecting its 
position within the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the United States:

> Quarterly, Azure and Argent, in dexter chief a star of the Second, a cross 
> botonny quarterly, Second and Gules.

<div class="row">
<div class="item col-md-2">&nbsp;</div>
{% include figure.html width="4"
   image="/2024/lord-baltimores-influence-on-marylands-heraldry/baltimore-archdiocese-arms.png" 
   alt="The Arms of the Archdiocese of Baltimore" cap="The Arms of the Archdiocese of Baltimore" %}
{% include figure.html width="4"
   image="/2024/lord-baltimores-influence-on-marylands-heraldry/crossland-arms.png" 
   alt="The Arms of Crossland" cap="The Arms of Crossland" %}
</div>

By adopting a variation of the Crossland arms and incorporating a
singular star, the Archdiocese's heraldry underscores its primacy
in the nation's Catholic Church, an elegant merger of tradition and
symbolism that resonates with the faithful and the broader community
alike.

## Conclusion

Maryland's embrace of heraldry offers a fascinating glimpse into
how ancient symbols can find new life in modern identities. From
civic to ecclesiastical, these emblems tell stories of valor, faith,
and learning, connecting the past to the present in a language of
colors and shapes that is as meaningful today as it was centuries
ago.
