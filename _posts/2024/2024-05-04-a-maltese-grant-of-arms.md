I am honored to announce a significant milestone in my personal and
professional journey—[a formal grant of arms](/honors/malta) bestowed
by the [Office of the Chief Herald of Arms of
Malta](https://maltaheraldry.mt/). This prestigious recognition is
a personal honor and a testament to a heritage of service and
scholarship that I hold dear.

With its rich traditions and rigorous standards, Heraldry bridges
past and present, symbolizing one's lineage, achievements, and
values. The grant I received on May 1, 2024, is a formal recognition
by Malta, a nation renowned for its historic commitment to heraldic
arts and chivalric traditions.

My grant of arms was meticulously crafted to reflect both my personal
heritage and professional accomplishments. Conferred by Count Charles
Anthony Gauci, the Chief Herald of Arms of Malta, the arms were
officially documented under the authority vested by the Malta
Government Gazette of June 25, 2019, and under Chapter 445 of the
Laws of Malta.

## Blazon of the Arms

"Argent in pale a tetrahedron Azure pierced in bend by a sword Or
with pommel and crosspiece of the Second. Upon a helm befitting his
degree with mantling Or and Azure is set for crest, upon a wreath
of the liveries a martlet Sable."

### The Crest

The central martlet, a heraldic bird that never lands, symbolizes
the continuous pursuit of knowledge and aspiration to improve
oneself.

### The Motto

The motto accompanying the arms, "Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb,"
which translates as "Only will leads the heart," is a guiding
principle for personal and professional endeavors, encapsulating a
philosophy of determination and leadership.

## Going Forward

This heraldic achievement is a symbol not only of personal identity
but also of the responsibilities and duties it embodies. It connects
me to a longstanding tradition of heraldry that honors one's past
while paving a path toward the future. These arms are now registered
under Archive Registration Number G0102/2024 at Fort Saint Elmo,
Valletta, ensuring their place in the annals of heraldic history.

The arms are to be borne and used henceforth by my descendants and
me in accordance with the norms of heraldry and under the ongoing
oversight of the Maltese heraldic authority. This grant is a
recognition and a charge to continue living by the values and
responsibilities these arms represent.

I am profoundly grateful for this honor and excited about the
opportunities it brings to further contribute to the communities
and fields represented by this new heraldic emblem. This recognition
reinforces my commitment to uphold the values it signifies and to
carry forth the legacy of service and excellence that the arms
represent.
