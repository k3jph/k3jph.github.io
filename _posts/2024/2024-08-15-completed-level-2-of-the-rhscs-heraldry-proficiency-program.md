I recently completed Level 2 of the [Royal Heraldry Society of Canada](https://www.heraldry.ca/)'s (RHSC)
[Heraldry Proficiency Program](https://www.heraldry.ca/content/pp_intro.php) and received my certificate. This program is a
structured course designed to deepen knowledge of heraldry in a systematic way,
offering participants a solid foundation and progressively more advanced
understanding of heraldic traditions and practices.  Level 1: Laying the
Groundwork

Level 1 of the program serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of
heraldry. It covers the basics, including the history of heraldry, its evolution
over time, and its significance across various cultures. This level places a
strong emphasis on terminologyâ€”learning the language of heraldry is essential
for understanding and discussing the subject accurately. Key terms such as
"[blazon](https://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/the-language-of-blazon/),"
"[tincture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tincture_(heraldry)),"
"[charge](https://rarebooks.nd.edu/digital/heraldry/charges/index.html)," and
"[ordinary](https://www.timeref.com/life/heraldry_ordinaries.htm)" are
introduced, forming the basis for more advanced study.

The course also covers the basic rules of heraldic design, including the Law of
Tincture, which governs the use of colors in heraldry. Participants are
introduced to different types of shields, ordinaries, and sub-ordinaries, and
learn how these elements are combined to create distinct coats of arms.
Additionally, Level 1 touches on heraldic symbolism, providing insight into the
meanings behind various symbols and colors used in heraldry.

## Level 2: Building on the Basics

With a solid foundation from Level 1, Level 2 delves deeper into the
complexities of heraldic art and design. This level expands on the principles of
heraldry, introducing more detailed rules for combining different elements
within a coat of arms. It also includes a study of heraldic law, offering an
overview of the legal aspects of heraldry, such as the rights to bear arms and
the procedures for granting arms.

Participants in Level 2 explore the different forms of heraldic representation,
including [crests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)),
[badges](https://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/topic/badges-standards/h)_,
and
[supporters](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry/Chapter_26),
and learn how these elements are arranged to convey specific meanings. They also
focus on heraldic art, with attention given to the various styles of rendering
arms and the importance of maintaining consistency in design.

Additionally, Level 2 touches on the role of heraldic authorities, discussing
their responsibilities in regulating and overseeing the use of heraldic symbols.

## The Certificate: A Work of Art

One of the highlights of completing each level is receiving the certificate,
which is not just a document of achievement but also a piece of art. The
certificate features beautiful hand-calligraphy, a testament to the tradition
and craftsmanship that heraldry embodies. The attention to detail in the
lettering and the overall design reflects the care and respect that the RHSC has
for the art of heraldry. It's a reminder of the skills and knowledge acquired
through the program and a beautiful addition to any heraldic collection.

## Looking Ahead

Having completed Level 2, I plan to continue through the program, working toward
the Licentiate of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada. This next step will
involve even more advanced study and a deeper exploration of the rich traditions
and practices of heraldry.

For those interested in heraldry, the RHSC's Heraldry Proficiency Program offers
a well-organized and comprehensive path to gaining knowledge in this fascinating
field. Each level builds on the last, making it an excellent resource for both
beginners and those looking to deepen their understanding of heraldry.
