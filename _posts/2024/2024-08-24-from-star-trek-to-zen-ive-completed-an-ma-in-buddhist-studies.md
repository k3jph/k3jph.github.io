I have been awarded a [Master of Arts in Buddhist
Studies](https://southwales.ac.uk/courses/ma-buddhist-studies/) from the
[University of South Wales](https://southwales.ac.uk/), graduating with
distinction. This part-time, distance-learning program provided a structured and
comprehensive exploration of Buddhist traditions, philosophies, and practices.

The program offered a step-by-step approach, introducing key concepts and
practices while providing an overview of the historical development of Buddhism
and its main sub-traditions. The coursework covered various aspects of Buddhism,
including Buddhist meditation and psychology, Buddhist ethics, and Buddhist
philosophy. Each module was designed to deepen understanding and foster a
nuanced appreciation of Buddhism across different cultures.

As part of the degree, I [completed a dissertation titled _The Needs of the Many
and the Few_](/assets/docs/JHoward-USW-Thesis.pdf), which presents a unique
exploration of Buddhist philosophy as portrayed in two iconic films from the
Star Trek franchise: _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_ and _Star Trek III: The
Search for Spock_. Through detailed analysis, the dissertation examines how
these films embody and reflect various aspects of Buddhist thought, including
concepts of karma, interconnectedness, and Right Livelihood. The study
contributes to a deeper understanding of the intersection between popular
culture, specifically science fiction, and Buddhist philosophy, presenting a
novel perspective on the ethical and philosophical dimensions of the Star Trek
universe.

Learning resources and interaction with tutors and fellow students were
facilitated through the University's Virtual Learning Environment, enabling
participation from anywhere in the world. This flexible structure was
particularly beneficial, allowing for a balance between rigorous academic study
and other commitments.

This degree represents a significant step forward in my exploration of Buddhist
thought, and I am looking forward to applying the insights and knowledge gained
in future practice.
