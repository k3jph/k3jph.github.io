Earlier this month, the Howard County government announced it would
shut down Gtv, the government's cable access channel.[^carson] Gtv
broadcasts civic interest programs, such as County Council meetings.
These services will be merged into HCC-TV, managed by Howard Community
College, which also shows civic and educational programs.

This announcement presents an opportunity for Howard County to
expand its broadcasting opportunities.  County Council meetings are
typically broadcast live and are rebroadcast during the week.  Howard
County should deliver this content on-demand over the Internet
through streaming video.  Montgomery County's government access
channel, County Cable Montgomery (CCM) broadcasts council and other
meeting live with rebroadcasts following.  However, CCM offers
streaming video online of meetings, complete with interactive
transcripts.[^moco]  The CCM video archive even allows users to
select specific sections of meetings.

Howard County could consider adopting similar technology for County
Council meetings and expanding the service to include the County's
decision making bodies, such as the Planning Board, Public Works
Board, and Board of Appeals.  This would expand citizen involvement
by making information readily available.
