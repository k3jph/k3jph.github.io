A week or so ago, Chase asked me about getting some vanilla syrup.
He had seen on the menu at [Roggenart](https://www.roggenart.com/)
a drink called the "London Fog" and was interested in trying it.
He could have ordered it, but Chase likes to cook, and that's
awesome.  The London Fog is an [Earl Grey-based
latte](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/food-and-drink/the-london-fog-was-invented-in-vancouver-and-we-spoke-to-the-woman-who-invented-it-3529023)
created by [Mary Loria](https://www.instagram.com/notyoureverydaymary).
The drink consists of:

* Earl Grey tea,
* Steamed milk, and
* A shot of vanilla syrup.

Well, we made it and liked it.  But naturally started playing with
it.  And so we have invented what we call "The London Frog," which
is the same drink, adding a shot of [spearmint
syrup](https://sonomasyrup.com/collections/all-products/products/no-2-mint-infused-simple-syrup).

It is amazing.

As an aside, we were worried it would taste like a [Shamrock
Shake](https://restaurantclicks.com/does-mcdonalds-have-shamrock-shakes/).
In this event, we were prepared to name it the "Dublin Fog," but
fortunately, that did not come to pass.
