Origami goes far beyond kids making paper fortune tellers.  In
recent years, origami has become a focal point for teaching
mathematics.  Origami has also been used for understanding
[biological](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-7532/ab80d5/meta)
and
[chemical](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/nr/c8nr10113b)
principles, as well as engineering folding designs for [use in
spaceflight](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.013002).
All of this makes understanding the nature of origami just as
important as understanding how to fold paper to create a shape.
The themes of negative space, the transition from folded to unfolded,
along with the intervening states, are all critical from practical
perspectives and can help us teach and use the art more effectively.

Origami may not appear simple.  Nontrivial origami of complex
objects, ranging from
[dragons](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-70736-1_12)
to [buildings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1309197) to an
entire book of origami animals, can be produced, even by novices.
An origami airplane, a paper airplane, can fly significant distances.
But all of these origami designs share one common property.  They
all consist of simple folds.  True origami does not permit cuts and
if unfolded, should yield the original sheet of paper.  Physicists
call this a "[rigid body
deformation](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sm/c8sm01341a),"
and this is the simplest transformation of the paper possible.  It
does not stretch, shear, or compress the paper.  No matter how
complex the final representation, it was created only through
successive folds.  Complexity arises from simple rules.

The idea that complexity stems from simple rules is also familiar
within the mathematical and computer science communities.  There
is an entire field known as artificial life that uses simple rules
to [model complex behavior](/2016/01/26/inspiring-books).  That
complex behavior though, is typically found in nature.  The idea
behind the field is that simplicity gives rise to complexity in
nature; an ant may only follow simple rules to forage and return
to the nest with food, but at scale, [complex eusocial behavior
emerges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdLwAA5fHHc).  Similarly,
origami represents the complexity found in natural settings via the
emergence of complexity from simplicity.

However, even without this metaphor, origami is also a straightforward
representation of nature.  Much origami represents living organisms.
Origami plants, birds, and other animals are _de  rigueur_ of the
artistic representation in the form.  Even the origami dragon
referred to earlier is a representation of a presumed nature, even
if the creature itself is a fantasy.  Representing nature places
the artist and viewer closer the symbolic representation of nature.
And again, this is a metaphor of nature that that the artist
essentially controls.  It is, however, less cooperative than other
forms of craft here; nature will not subtly subvert the artist while
the artist works.

That does not mean nature plays no role.  Because origami is
constructed from paper, it is fragile and will not last as long as
a sculpture of the same animal in stone.  Origami, is, in fact,
[entirely
ephemeral](https://mymodernmet.com/history-of-origami-definition/).  Paper,
degrades over time, even if well maintained.
The paper of origami is even more fragile than other instances; a
book is protected against the elements by being bound and shelved.
Origami has no such protection.  Even the folds degrade the paper,
as the stress on the paper at the fold can lead to tearing or just
wear through over time, especially if unfolded and refolded many
times.  Even more directly, an origami craft piece can be unfolded
the paper put to another use, practical or not.

The symbolic impermanence of origami has a [special place in Japanese
myth](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/senbazuru-paper-cranes-2540651),
as well.  A common practice in Japan is to fold one thousand origami
cranes, a mystical creature in Japanese tradition.  After folding
one thousand cranes, the cranes may be offered in exchange for a
wish.  Because of this, a thousand origami cranes are often given
to those who are ill, who may offer the cranes in exchange for a
wish of good health.  Some temples in Japan allow for cranes to be
placed near eternal flames.  As the cranes are left outdoors, they
rapidly degrade due to exposure and the wish is symbolically released.
[Impermanence](https://www.lionsroar.com/impermanence-is-buddha-nature-embrace-changemay-2012/),
here, is necessary for the ritual's success.

Finally, we must consider the imperfection of origami.  One key
form of imperfection origami recognizes is asymmetry.  Asymmetry
in wabi-sabi refers to "[design that emphasises irregularity or
unevenness](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17543266.2016.1165740)."
While it is possible to construct origami symmetrically, as, for
instance, a well made paper airplane is, there is a preference for
asymmetric designs.  An origami bird has a tilted or turned head,
for instance.  Beyond adding a degree of asymmetric reasoning to
the craft, it also gives the design a greater sense of life.  If
the head is turned, suddenly, it is looking at something and rather
than a representation of a bird we now see a representation of a
living bird, in its natural state.  Imperfection leads to nature
as wabi-sabi principles lead back to each other.

Origami, like other native and nearly native craft forms in Japan,
is heavily influenced by the culture in which it thrives.  This,
almost, is to be expected as counter cultural movements obviously
do not have a mechanism to perpetuate themselves.  By adhering to
cultural norms, these craft forms ensure their own survival, and
that adherence has left indelible marks on the crafts' standard
forms.  We can infer from this just how powerful the concepts of
Buddhist philosophy, and wabi-sabi in particular, were during the
formative  years of each of these artistic traditions.
