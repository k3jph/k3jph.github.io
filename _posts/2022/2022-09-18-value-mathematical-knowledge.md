A few years ago, I was teaching public finance. My students,
generally, while grad students, probably had not had microeconomics.
And if they have, it really didn't stick. So I spend the first few
weeks "reviewing" microeconomics, which means I teach all the bits
of micro they will need to get through public finance. So far, so
good.

So, I gave a 20-minutes introduction to pricing. This was the whole
marginal cost = variable cost = long-run average cost = price spiel.
As a general rule, I don't give proofs in class. Proofs are for
journal articles and lesser professors. But I do want the student
to have an intuitive understanding of why something is true. For
those baked in the formal sciences, a proof does that. For those
not, well, a walk-through is usually sufficient.

So I give them $$AC = VC + FC / n$$, where n is the number of units.
In a proof, I would write $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}{AC} = \lim_{n
\rightarrow \infty}{VC + FC / n} = VC + 0 = VC$$, LaTeX it, and
move on. But that's not going to help, like, normal people. So
instead, I go back to $$AC = VC + FC / n$$ and I asked, "What happens
to this as we sell more units?" Blank stares, so I say, "I give
you," and point, "a dollar. How much do you have?" And the student
responds, "a dollar." So then I ask, "Okay, I am going to split a
dollar between you and you; then how much do you each get?" "Fifty
cents." We continue this to a hypothetical million students, and
they are starting to get the gist of the limit, if not the specifics.
Then we kind of realize the FC can just disappear.

At this point, I've fairly well convinced the class that $$AC = VC
= MC$$ and am starting on the price when I hear a student note that
they didn't expect the math to be so difficult. This is like,
eighth-grade algebra, setting aside the limit I kept hidden under
the table anyway. And it wasn't the limit that scared them. It was
the algebra.

And that's frustrating because it shouldn't be that hard.
