Bringing pseudo-science into what should be a rigorous classroom experience weakens the school curriculum and will produce a generation of graduates incapable of understanding real science. A theory is a hypothesis that has stood up to a battery of tests aimed at disproving that hypothesis. Evolution is a framework under which diverse theories that meet this definition compete. Intelligent design qualifies as neither a theory nor hypothesis as it cannot, by its very nature, be disproved.

When students attribute an observation to fate, luck or supernatural forces, they have failed as scientists. The promoters of intelligent design should realise that it has no place in the sciences. Most schools have given up teaching philosophy, but that is where this subject belongs.
