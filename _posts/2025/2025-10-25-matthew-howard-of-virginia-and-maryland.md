The early Chesapeake was shaped by a wide cast of settlers, from landed gentry
and indentured servants to Puritan merchants and opportunists. Among the names
that recur in seventeenth-century Virginia and Maryland is Matthew Howard
(1600s–1650s), an immigrant whose children helped anchor settlement on the
Severn and left a mark on provincial life.

The first clear notice of Howard appears in February 1637, when a land patent to
[Robert
Taylor](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc5800/sc5881/000001/000000/000129/pdf/msa_sc_5881_1_129.pdf)
described Taylor's 100 acres as bounded on the west by land of Matthew Howard.
By August 1638, King Charles I granted Howard 150 acres in Elizabeth City County
for the "adventure" of his wife Ann and two white servants. Under Virginia's
[headright
system](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/indentured-servants-in-colonial-virginia/),
planters received fifty acres for each person whose passage they financed. The
grant places Howard among those with the means to move dependents and labor
across the Atlantic. His lands adjoined properties of families such as the
Lloyds, Sandys, and Willoughbys, a reminder that settlement proceeded through
networks as much as through maps.

Howard's origins remain uncertain, but his associations are not. He lived among
the [Puritan community in colonial
Virginia](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/puritans-in-colonial-virginia/)
in Lower Norfolk and had close ties to Edward and Cornelius Lloyd, influential
merchants and planters. Tension with Virginia's established Anglican authorities
sharpened in the 1640s. When Cecil Calvert invited the Puritans to Maryland,
where toleration for Christians had firmer footing under the [1649 Act
Concerning
Religion](https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/7989/html/tolerga.html),
many packed up and crossed the line. Howard went with them.

Matthew's wife is usually identified as Ann. In 1645, proved 1648, Richard Hall
of Lower Norfolk left his estate to the children of Matthew and Ann Howard and
named Matthew executor. The bequest implies a strong relationship. Some have
inferred that Ann was Hall's niece, Ann Hall; the record does not prove it. What
the will does show is Howard's standing and the trust he commanded among
neighbors. A brief abstract of [Richard Hall's
will](https://archive.org/details/briefabstractofl00bruce/page/358/mode/2up)
records the bequests.

The children most commonly attributed to Matthew and Ann are:

1.  Samuel Howard (c. 1628–1703). Married Catherine Warner, daughter of James
    Warner and Elizabeth Harris. He held land in Anne Arundel County and served
    as a justice of the peace. His descendants intermarried with the Dorsey,
    Ridgely, and Warfield families.
2.  John Howard (c. 1630–1696). Married Mary (surname uncertain), later Juliet
    Warfield. He lived at Round Bay on the Severn, served in the militia, and
    sealed his 1695 will with the undifferenced Howard arms, a point later
    pressed by those arguing for noble descent.
3.  Cornelius Howard (c. 1635–1680). Likely named for Cornelius Lloyd. Married
    Elizabeth, possibly a daughter of John Todd. By 1660 he held land in Anne
    Arundel County; in 1679 he sold "Howard's and Porter's Range" to Adam
    Shipley. His tract ["Howard's
    Hope"](https://mdhistory.msa.maryland.gov/msaref09/pdf/baldwin_vol01.pdf)
    appears in the _Maryland Calendar of Wills_.
4.  Philip Howard (d. 1705). Married Sarah (surname uncertain). His holdings
    included tracts known as Warner's Neck and Howard's Inheritance.
5.  Matthew Howard Jr. Records are thin. Some researchers believe he died young
    or remained in Virginia.
6.  Mary Howard and Anne Howard. Both married into neighboring families;
    documentation is scattered.

By 1649, enforcement of Anglican conformity in Virginia had intensified. The
Puritan migration to Maryland gathered force, and Howard settled with the Lloyd
party on the Severn near the town of
[Providence](https://www.losttownsproject.org/research/archaeological-sites/providence-1649/),
the site of modern Annapolis. A survey dated 3 July 1650 noted land laid out for
Matthew Howard on the south side of the Severn near Marsh's Creek, about 350
acres, and another tract of roughly the same size running with Howard's Swamp;
occupation often preceded patent, and the [1650 survey
certificate](https://www.weech.net/ashley/Founders_of_Anne_Arundel_and_Howard_Counties-MARYLAND_Warfield_1905.pdf)
preserves the survey language.

Howard died between 1658 and 1659. His name falls out of the record just as his
sons begin to patent and convey the Severn lands. John, Samuel, and Cornelius
secured tracts that came to be called [Howard's
Inheritance](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc5800/sc5881/000001/000000/000102/pdf/msa_sc_5881_1_102.pdf),
[Howard's
Heirship](https://speccol.msa.maryland.gov/pages/speccol/series.aspx?series=1&speccol=21),
and [Howard's
Hope](https://mdhistory.msa.maryland.gov/msaref09/pdf/baldwin_vol01.pdf), and
added acreage through headrights and purchase. By the 1670s the family
controlled substantial ground around Round Bay.

The pattern of life that frames these choices is familiar. Tobacco drove the
Chesapeake economy, and the [headright
system](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/indentured-servants-in-colonial-virginia/)
rewarded anyone who financed the passage of family, servants, or tenants.
Planters like Howard also grew maize and beans, kept cattle and hogs, and traded
surplus along the
[waterways](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/sites/default/files/media/file/wib17colonizationchesapeakefinal.pdf).
Labor needs were heavy. Indentured servants supplied much of it in the 1630s and
1640s, with enslaved Africans forming a growing share by century's end in
[colonial
Virginia](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/colonial-virginia/).
Religious life and politics were deeply entangled. Sir William Berkeley's return
to the Virginia governorship in 1642 brought stricter conformity. Disarming
Puritan militia and expelling their ministers pushed dissenters toward Maryland,
where the [1649 Act of
Toleration](https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/7989/html/tolerga.html)
offered a safer berth as [Puritan congregations in
Virginia](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/puritans-in-colonial-virginia/)
faced disarmament and expulsion. Howard's move fits that current.

On questions of religion, the available evidence points to Puritan alignment
rather than to Anglican or Catholic identity. Howard migrated with the Lloyds
and settled at Providence, a Puritan enclave. There is no record of recusancy
fines for him or his sons.

Howard's children helped turn surveys into a settlement. Samuel repeatedly
served as a justice of the peace, sat on juries, and handled routine county
business. John was active in the militia and appears in civic matters along the
Severn. Cornelius acquired and traded land, later reaching into what became
Baltimore County. Through marriages into the Warner, Ridgely, Warfield, Chew,
Todd, Dorsey, Worthington, Worthington-adjacent, and other families, the Howards
extended their network across central Maryland. Within a generation, they had
ties to the assembly, to parish vestries, and to merchant ventures in Annapolis.

One artifact has drawn perennial interest: the seal on John Howard's 1695 will.
[Fredric Z. Saunders](https://fzsaunders.com/howard.html) notes that the wax
shows the Howard arms, "gules, a bend between six cross-crosslets fitchée
argent," without the Flodden augmentation later borne by the ducal line.
Colonial gentlemen sometimes adopted prestigious arms without legal right, so
the seal does not prove descent. It does, however, show how identity and
aspiration were expressed in the colony. 

Matthew Howard's appeal lies less in conjectured ancestry than in the record of
what he and his children did. He arrived in Virginia with enough resources to
claim land, built alliances with influential neighbors, moved to Maryland when
policy and conscience pointed that way, and left children who served, traded,
and married their way into the province's fabric. The names of their tracts, the
appearance of their signatures on county business, and the persistence of their
kin across Anne Arundel and beyond tell that story plainly. Whatever the fog
around his birth, the life that can be documented is the one that matters here.
