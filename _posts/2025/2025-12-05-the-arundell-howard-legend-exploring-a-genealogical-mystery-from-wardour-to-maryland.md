Ever since I wrote about [Thomas Arundell of
Wardour](/2025/09/07/thomas-arundell-of-wardour-hero-of-the-empire) and followed
it with a look at [Matthew Howard of Virginia and
Maryland](/2025/10/25/matthew-howard-of-virginia-and-maryland), it has been
impossible to avoid the story that links the two men. The first post examined an
English nobleman whose career straddled the political and religious tensions of
the early seventeenth century. The second introduced a colonial settler whose
name appears in the records of Virginia and later Maryland. The reason these two
figures are so frequently tied together has less to do with documented history
and much more to do with a genealogical legend that has persisted for more than
a century.

According to that legend, Matthew Howard was not born a Howard at all. Instead,
the tale insists he was the missing son of Thomas Arundell, spirited out of
England under his grandmother's surname in order to escape the dangers that had
already claimed so many members of the Wardour line. In this telling, the
anonymous immigrant who turns up in the Chesapeake in the 1630s is actually
Matthew Arundell, baptised in London in 1609, recorded as dead in 1620, and then
resurrected in Virginia with a new identity and a new life.

It is a compelling story. It contains aristocratic intrigue, a secret exile, a
new world, and a coat of arms waiting to be rediscovered. It also survives on a
remarkably thin documentary foundation. Yet it continues to show up in family
papers, printed genealogies, and the occasional lineage-society application.
Given the enthusiasm with which the legend is repeated, it is worth sorting the
record from the romance.

The story begins with two parish entries at St Andrew's, Holborn. [On 19 June
1609, a child named Mathew
Arundel](https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/1624/records/4953753) was
baptised as the son of Thomas, Lord Arundell of Wardour, and Anne Philipson.
[Another entry dated 2 June 1620 reports that "Matthew Arundell, son of Thomas,
Lord Arundell, out of Castill Yard in Holborne, was buried in the Chancell under
the Table."](https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/1624/records/922213398)
The burial entry is clear, detailed, and consistent with the practice of burying
noble children in prominent locations within parish churches. But beginning in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, genealogists proposed an
alternative reading. They argued that the burial was either falsified or
referred to a different child. [Alice Norris Parran's _Register of Maryland's
Heraldic Families_](https://www.familysearch.org/en/search/catalog/176229)
(1938) repeated the claim that the boy had not died at all but had instead
disappeared, a term she interpreted as an intentional removal from England.

Parran's narrative added layers that made the story more attractive. She linked
the supposed escape to the political dangers that had shaped the Arundell family
for generations, then tied the boy's safety to Virginia, where families with
surnames like Arundell, Wriothesley, Willoughby, and Sandys did appear in land
patents in Elizabeth City County. She then merged this line of reasoning with
the known record of Matthew Howard, who appears in Virginia by the 1630s,
marries a woman named Ann, acquires land through the headright system, and joins
the Puritans who resettled in Maryland in 1649. The connection was
circumstantial, but in the hands of early twentieth-century genealogists it
gained a life of its own. Parran wrote that her version had been accepted by
several lineage societies, and she presented this acceptance as evidence of its
accuracy.

Other genealogical works amplified the claim. [Zella Armstrong's _Notable
Southern
Families_](https://archive.org/details/notablesouthernf01arms/page/n209/mode/2up)
and [Harry Wright Newman's _Anne Arundel
Gentry_](https://archive.org/details/annearundelgentr00newm_0/page/236/mode/2up)
repeated variations of the story. Newman acknowledged the lack of documentation
but still included the claim as a possibility. In this way the idea spread. Once
it appeared in print, later writers treated the earlier works as independent
corroboration, even though each retelling relied on the same small cluster of
assertions.

Several kinds of evidence are usually offered in support of the legend. The
first is the baptism and burial pair from Holborn. Supporters argue the records
are either misattributed or intentionally misleading. The second is the absence
of later English references to Matthew Arundell, which they interpret as a sign
of his removal from England. The third is the clustering of familiar English
surnames in early Virginia patents, including names that also appear in
aristocratic contexts. The fourth is Matthew Howard's move with the Puritan
migration to Maryland and his substantial landholdings, which they view as
consistent with gentry origin. The fifth is the use of undifferenced Howard arms
on the seal of John Howard's 1695 will. The sixth is the endorsement of early
lineage societies that accepted Edyth Shipley Britons's application.

Each point has surface appeal, but all break down once examined. The burial
entry from 1620 is explicit and detailed, and nothing in the record hints at a
substitution. [Fredric Z. Saunders reviews the
entry](https://fzsaunders.com/howardarun.html) and notes that the burial
location, the specificity of the entry, and the general consistency of the
parish register leave little room for the kind of error the legend requires.
Occam's razor applies. The child died in 1620.

The absence of later English references is also far from unique. Early modern
records often do not account for every younger son. Many died without leaving a
will or property, and their names disappear from the surviving record. This is
common enough that silence provides no evidence of survival.

The appearance of surnames like Arundell, Wriothesley, and Sandys in Virginia
patents proves migration patterns, not kinship. These individuals were likely
not connected to Wardour at all. The headright system encouraged investors to
transport unrelated laborers, servants, neighbors, and business associates.
Migration clusters exist throughout the records of the 1620s and 1630s without
signaling aristocratic ties.

The heraldry point is comoplicated. The seal on John Howard's will uses
undifferenced Howard arms but omits the [Flodden
augmentation](https://amateurheralds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=422) granted to
the ducal line in 1513. Colonial Americans regularly adopted arms without
authority, and the absence of proper differences suggests assertion rather than
right. [Saunders reviews this issue, too,](https://fzsaunders.com/howard.html)
and notes that if the Howards of Maryland had inherited the arms through
[Margaret Howard](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Howard-253), they should have
used a differenced form. They did not. Margaret Howard was herself daughter of
[Edmund Howard,](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Howard-180) third son of the
[second Duke of Norfolk](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Howard-2).  The [cadency
rules we think of in
differencing](https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/resources/the-law-of-arms) were
created only after all of these people were dead and within a family,
differencing in England was always more optional than not.  Even the venerable
[House of Howard](https://wappenwiki.org/index.php/House_of_Howard) generally
differenced only when a branch was granted a peerage.  Accordingly, John
Howard's seal could reasonably have been the undifferenced arms of Howard
without the Flodden augmentation if he were a descendant of Margaret Howard
_and_ using the name.

The religious argument does not help the legend either. The Wardour Arundells
were Catholics who appeared in recusancy records, paid fines, and maintained
Catholic practice. There is no evidence that Matthew Howard or his known
descendants were Catholic, and his close association with Puritan neighbors
suggests the opposite. It is difficult to imagine a Catholic child from an
aristocratic family being raised among Puritans as a means of protection. 

Finally, the endorsement by lineage societies reflects the documentation
standards of the early twentieth century. Many societies accepted printed
genealogies as evidence, especially when the applicant was a member in good
standing. This acceptance is not equivalent to proof.

Taken together, these weaknesses explain why modern researchers doubt the
Arundell-Howard link. The legend relies on speculation, reinterpretation of
straightforward records, and coincidences presented as patterns. It also hinges
on dismissing the one clear and contemporaneous document that exists: the 1620
burial record of Thomas Arundell's son.

Alternative theories have been proposed, such as a Howard-Douglas connection or
a tie to cadet branches of the Norfolk Howards, but these rest on no documentary
evidence either. At present, the ancestry of Matthew Howard remains unknown. The
absence of a known origin is not a license to invent one. It is only a reminder
that many colonial immigrants left few traces in the English record.

Even so, the legend persists. Noble ancestry is appealing. Repetition gives the
impression of verification. Heraldry creates a sense of inherited identity even
when there is none. And the lack of a documented English origin leaves a
narrative vacuum that many are eager to fill.

There is no need to reject the legend with hostility. It is enough to recognize
that it does not match the documentary record. A child baptised in 1609 was
buried in 1620. A settler named Matthew Howard appears in Virginia more than a
decade later. There is no evidence that these two individuals are the same
person. Until new archival material emerges, the story remains an example of how
easily family tradition takes on the appearance of fact.

That uncertainty is not a failing. It is a space where honest historical work
continues. The origins of Matthew Howard remain an open question, and part of
the work of genealogy is learning where the record ends and imagination begins.
