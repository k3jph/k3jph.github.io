Someone recently wrote, "If it was billions of years old, the sun should have
burned out long ago."" It was offered in support of a [creationist
argument](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/15-answers-to-creationist/),
though without much elaboration. I replied, "How do you know?" The answer came
back, "Simple mathematics." When I asked to see the math, the comment
disappeared. So I did the simple math.

The claim is that the Sun cannot be billions of years old because it would have
exhausted its fuel supply by now. But that only makes sense if you do not
understand how the Sun generates energy. It is not burning anything in the usual
sense, which would mean a chemical reaction involving oxygen. This is not a
chemical reaction. This is a nuclear reaction. The Sun fuses hydrogen into
helium deep in its core. That process is well understood, measured, and even
observed directly through the neutrinos it produces. And it gives us a perfectly
good way to estimate how long the Sun has been active and how much longer it
will shine.

## How the Sun Actually Produces Energy

The Sun is not a bonfire. It does not burn wood or coal or gas. It fuses
hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy through nuclear fusion. The
main process is the proton-proton chain reaction, which looks like this:

\[
4\,\ce{^1H} \rightarrow \ce{^4He} + 2e^+ + 2\nu_e + \text{energy}
\]

Some mass is lost in the process, and that mass is converted to energy through
[Einstein's famous
equation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/andp.19053231314):

\[
E = mc^2
\]

This is the core of solar power.

## How Much Energy Does the Sun Emit?

The Sun's total energy output is called its
[luminosity](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/stellar-luminosity-guide), and
it is about

\[
L_{\odot} \approx 3.846 \times 10^{26} \text{ watts}
\]

That means the Sun emits roughly \( 3.846 \times 10^{26} \) joules of energy
every second.

To find out how much mass is converted into energy per second, we rearrange
Einstein's equation:

\[
m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{3.846 \times 10^{26} \, \text{J}}{(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})^2} \approx 4.29 \times 10^9 \, \text{kg/s}
\]

That is about 4.3 million metric tons of mass lost per second to fusion.  That
is the mass of about 720 [Great Pyramids of
Giza](https://egymonuments.gov.eg/en/monuments/the-great-pyramid) every second.

## How Much Hydrogen Is That?

Fusion does not turn all the hydrogen into energy. Only about 0.7% of the
original hydrogen mass becomes energy. So to produce the energy equivalent of
4.3 million tons of mass, the Sun needs to fuse:

\[
\frac{4.29 \times 10^9}{0.007} \approx 6.13 \times 10^{11} \, \text{kg}
\]

This means the Sun fuses about 613 million metric tons of hydrogen every
second, producing about 609 million tons of helium and converting the rest
into energy.

## And How Old Is the Sun?

We can also use the hydrogen consumption rate to estimate how long the Sun has
been fusing hydrogen. The Sun's total mass is about [latex]1.9885 \times
10^{30}[/latex] kilograms, but only the innermost 10%, the core, is under the
right conditions for sustained fusion. That gives us about [latex]1.9885 \times
10^{29}[/latex] kilograms of usable hydrogen fuel.

Assuming the Sun fuses hydrogen at a rate of roughly [latex]6.13 \times
10^{11}[/latex] kilograms per second, and that it's about halfway through that
usable core hydrogen (as current stellar models suggest), then it has already
spent:

\[
t = \frac{0.5 \times 1.9885 \times 10^{29}}{6.13 \times 10^{11}} \approx 1.62 \times 10^{17} \, \text{seconds}
\]

Convert that to years:

\[
\frac{1.62 \times 10^{17}}{60 \times 60 \times 24 \times 365.25} \approx 5.1 \, \text{billion years}
\]

Which aligns closely with independent estimates of the Sun's age, based on
[radiometric dating](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/radiometric-dating/) of
solar system material and [stellar evolutionary
models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/stellar-model).

## Will the Sun Run Out Soon?

The Sun's total mass is about:

\[
M_{\odot} \approx 1.9885 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}
\]

Only about 10% of that is in the core and available for fusion:

\[
M_{\text{fuel}} \approx 0.1 \times 1.9885 \times 10^{30} = 1.9885 \times 10^{29} \, \text{kg}
\]

Divide the usable fuel by the rate at which it is being consumed:

\[
\frac{1.9885 \times 10^{29}}{6.13 \times 10^{11}} \approx 3.24 \times 10^{17} \, \text{seconds}
\]

Convert that to years:

\[
\frac{3.24 \times 10^{17}}{60 \times 60 \times 24 \times 365.25} \approx 10.3 \, \text{billion years}
\]

This is exactly what stellar models predict: the Sun will spend about 10 billion
years on the main sequence. Since it is about 4.6 billion years old now, it is
roughly halfway through its life.

## Why This Is Not a New Problem

In the 19th century, before fusion was understood, physicists like [Lord
Kelvin](https://www.gla.ac.uk/explore/lordkelvin200/) assumed the Sun was
powered by gravitational contraction. That would have made it only a few million
years old, which clashed with geologic and evolutionary evidence. The discovery
of nuclear fusion solved this discrepancy. The math works. The observations
match. We can even detect solar neutrinos from the proton-proton chain,
confirming the process.

## The Bottom Line

The Sun is not burning out. It is halfway through a 10-billion-year life, and it
is fueled by a process millions of times more efficient than fire. The claim
that the Sun should have burned out by now is based on a misunderstanding of how
stars work.

If the Sun were burning coal, it would have gone dark long before trilobites.
But it is not. It is burning hydrogen in the only way the universe knows how to
power a star.
