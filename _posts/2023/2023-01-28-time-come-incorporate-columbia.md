Columbia, Maryland, is a vibrant and growing community that has
been a leader in urban planning and development for decades. Despite
its many achievements, however, Columbia remains unincorporated,
which means that it does not have the same level of autonomy and
self-governance as a city. This is a situation that should change,
as there are many compelling reasons why Columbia should be
incorporated as a city.

The [recent management challenges in
Columbia](https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/howard-county/columbia-association-board-accepts-resignation-of-ceo-lakey-boyd-ending-months-of-rancor-KPF6FQHN2NHCHPOCMPDWOU5IQU/)
have highlighted the limitations of the current governance structure.
The Columbia Association, which serves as the community's primary
governance entity, has struggled to effectively address issues such
as budget deficits, [aging

and [community
dissatisfaction](https://chaowu.org/2018/02/06/2018-ca-budget-public-hearing-the-villager-2018-02/).
This is complicated by the [electoral
structure](https://www.themerriweatherpost.org/post/columbia-council-and-village-board-elections-draw-few-candidates-a-rundown-of-the-races),
where representatives to the Columbia Council [represent radically
unbalanced
districts](https://www.columbiaassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CharacteristicsofColumbiaM.pdf),
and the election process keeps the voting population below ten
percent of the population.

Incorporation would give Columbia a stronger and more accountable
government that is better equipped to address the community's needs
and concerns. Additionally, as a city, Columbia would have more
legal powers to address the issues that have been pointed out as
challenges, such as the ability to levy taxes, pass laws, and so
on. This would provide Columbia with more resources and the ability
to act on the community's behalf.

One of the main reasons why Columbia should be incorporated as a
city is that it has a population of over 100,000 residents. This
is a significant number of people who deserve to have a say in how
their community is run and managed. Incorporation would give residents
the ability to elect their own mayor and city council, which would
give them more control over local issues such as zoning, development,
and public services.

Incorporation would also provide Columbia with more autonomy and
flexibility when it comes to budgeting and financing. As an
unincorporated community, Columbia relies on the county government
for funding and support.  However, because Columbia services, like
parks and recreation, are provided by the Columbia Association,
Howard County diverts tax dollars paid by Columbia residents to
support the rest of the county.

Finally, incorporation would give Columbia the ability to create
and implement its own policies and regulations. For example, the
community could create its own zoning laws and regulations, which
would give it more control over the development of the community.
For decades, the development and management of Columbia has had a
thumb on the scale from outside Columbia.  Key boards, like the
[Board of
Appeals](https://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals)[^1]
and [Planning
Board](https://www.howardcountymd.gov/boards-commissions/planning-board),
often have a majority of members appointed from outside Columbia.
Though the Planning Board currently has a majority from Columbia,
this is especially important because the Planning Board serves as
the decisionmaker on Columbia development matters, because of the
structure of New Town zoning.

In conclusion, Columbia, Maryland, is an amazing community that
needs to be incorporated as a city. Incorporation would give residents
more control over their community and provide the community with
more autonomy and flexibility. It is time for Columbia to take the
next step and become a city.
