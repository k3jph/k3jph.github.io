Children's sporting events have three types of parent attendees.
Some are pushers.  They push their children to achieve more and
perform.  Kick further, steal the base, or hit the three-pointer.
Others are the organizers.  They keep the events running and,
thankfully for the rest of us, usually succeed.

The third type of parent is just there and trying to get something
else done in between at-bats and volleys.  It's not that we don't
care.  We'll celebrate our children's wins and hug them when they
lose.  But we go to a lot of these things, and they all have a lot
of downtime.  And there's nothing like the downtime at a chess
tournament.

The youngest kids play five half-hour matches over five or six
hours.  Since the kids only play for about half that time, they
spend a lot of it running around.  A bunch play chess against each other
for practice.  Others hit the basketball courts.  Some grab a snack.
Regardless of what type of parent you are, you've self-segregated
by school.  Even among the chess parents, the class differences are
clear among the private schools, the parochial schools, and the
good public schools.  The bad public schools aren't even represented.

One mother turns and asks me if I have any good recipes.  I wasn't
sure what she meant, so I asked.  She said, "My church is putting
together a recipe book for the members.  Do you have anything I can
add?"  I usually don't keep recipes on hand.  I have to look at the
chocolate chip cookie recipe on the bag of the chip bag every time.

There's only one recipe I ever wrote down: Cincinnati-style chili.
This recipe was given to me by my mother.  But she wasn't from
Cincinnati, and she learned it from my father, who was.  And he
learned it from his mother.  And I am pretty sure she stole it from
a friend in the mid-1960s.  My family is not one to stand for
tradition.

Most people think of Cincinnati-style chili as the funny chili that
has chocolate in it.  Or the weird chili served over spaghetti
noodles.  When made correctly, there is no chocolate in Cincinnati-style
chili, but it is served over spaghetti.  But that's just the
beginning.

Cincinnati was founded in the late 1700s and saw successive waves
of immigrants from Germany, Greece, and then Russia.  But Cincinnati
isn't a coastal city and these immigrants came through New York.
And along came native New Yorkers, and at one point, Cincinnati was
the second largest city in America.  She earned the nickname the
[Queen
City](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/12/22/why-cincinnati-called-queen-city/4007103001/).
These immigration patterns left a mark and in the city proper, the
[accent sounds like you're sitting in
Manhattan](https://www.city-data.com/forum/cincinnati/1042874-cincinati-accent-10.html).
Just outside the city, the slow drawl of the southern midland accent
wraps R's into wash and the [Northern Cities
shift](https://www.npr.org/2006/02/16/5220090/american-accent-undergoing-great-vowel-shift)
continues moving vowels out of place.

Some of the Greek immigrants created a Greek-style beef stew with
ground beef and Mediterranean spices.  Cumin, cinnamon, and allspice,
but no chocolate.  [Tom and John
Kiradjieff](https://dannwoellertthefoodetymologist.wordpress.com/2022/10/24/john-kiradjieff-the-inventor-of-cincinnati-chili-and-his-spice-house/),
two of these immigrants, sold the stew as a topping for hot dogs.
The Kiradjieff brothers created the Empress restaurant, the first
of a series of chili parlors throughout the region. They put the
chili on top of spaghetti, learned from Italian immigrants they had
met in New York.

This chili came to be served via the way-system.  You can get a
three-way, with spaghetti, chili, and finely shredded cheddar cheese.
Starting with a mild cheddar, one that holds up to small cuts,
instead of crumbling, is grated with a narrow grater.  The cheese
is left light and nearly fluffy in its consistency, and it melts
quickly with even modest heat of the chili on the plate.

You can also get a four-way, which includes a finely diced white
onion between the chili and cheese.  Some will claim you can put
in kidney beans, but a purist will tell you a four-way is onion.
Then there's a five-way, which includes both the onions and the
beans.  Whichever way you go, dropping a handful of oyster crackers
on top finishes it off.

Someone probably left hot sauce on the table, too, and it was likely
Tabasco.  Some will add this on top of the cheese.  But when the
server came to take your order, he probably brought over the oyster
crackers then.  Oyster crackers, commercially and bulk produced,
are hexagonally shaped, complete with perforations for breaking
apart still present.  These are the same oyster crackers seen up
and down the East Coast.  The side up in the oven probably puffed
up and broke open.  So while you're waiting for the chili, you drop
some Tabasco inside the cracker and pop it.  The kids call it cracker
bomb, but it's just hot sauce for the sake of hot sauce.

You can usually get a coney.  It's a short hotdog on a short bun.
The hotdog, like everything else, has been cooking all day and will
arrive within five minutes of ordering.  The short bun, though, has
been steamed, leaving it warm and soft, and a thin layer of mustard
is added before the hotdog.  The diced onion can be added here,
too, and the cheddar tops it off.  If you let it sit for more than
a couple of minutes, you're better off eating it with a fork.

The chili itself has a lot of water.  It's not greasy, as some
suggest, just runny.  It is pulled out of the pot with a slotted
spoon, but that can only do so much.  The water collects at the
bottom of the dish with the spaghetti.  That's the advantage of the
finely grated cheddar and crackers.  Everything absorbs at the end
into a nice dense casserole, allowing you to clean the plate.

More Greek immigrants started chili parlors.  In 1949, Nicholas
Lambrinides started [Skyline Chili](https://www.skylinechili.com/).
In the 1960s, some Jordanian immigrants started [Gold Star
Chili](https://www.goldstarchili.com/).  Skyline and Gold Star
dominate the market in the Cincinnati region now.  Empress is long
gone.  Smaller boutique and family-based chili parlors continue to
open in and around Cincinnati, adding their own flare to the
tradition, one of them a [rehashing of
Empress](https://empresschilialexandria.com/).

It is a simple dish that is affordable and easy to obtain, making
it a popular choice for those who are looking for a quick and filling
meal. The dish is known for its unique flavor profile, which includes
a blend of spices and seasonings that are combined with ground beef
to create a hearty, savory sauce.

Cincinnati-style chili is a classic example of peasant food, the
kind of traditional dishes that are simple, hearty, and made from
easily accessible and inexpensive ingredients. These dishes were
typically created by rural populations, who often had limited
resources and access to fresh produce. As a result, peasant food
often relied on staples such as grains, beans, and root vegetables,
which could be stored for long periods of time and were relatively
cheap.

Peasant food was, and in some cases still is, an important part of
the diet in many cultures around the world. In Europe, for example,
dishes such as stews, soups, and porridges were staple meals for
rural communities. In Latin America, beans and corn have long been
the foundation of peasant cuisine, while in Asia, rice and noodles
have played a similar role.  We see these themes in many regional
foods across the United States.

Despite its simplicity, Cincinnati-style chili is a satisfying meal
that can be enjoyed on its own or served over a bed of spaghetti.
One of the defining characteristics of this dish is its lack of
real vegetables, which sets it apart from other types of chili.
However, this does not detract from its overall appeal, as the
flavors of the beef and spices are enough to satisfy even the most
discerning of palates.

Despite its humble origins, peasant food has a timeless appeal, and
many traditional dishes have found their way into the mainstream.
Today, peasant food is often celebrated as a symbol of comfort and
authenticity, and has inspired many modern chefs to reinterpret
these classic recipes using fresh and seasonal ingredients.

My friends know the highest honor I can give them is making them
chili.  And my friends add their own flare.  One replaced the cheddar
with crumbled feta, leading to a crisis of authenticity.  After
all, it is Greek, so why not add feta.  I've even made it quite
successfully with meat substitutes for vegetarians, and depending
on which meat substitute you use, it may be indistinguishable from
the real thing.  You can even get it in a can, produced by Skyline
or Gold Star at grocers around the country.

After a century in Cincinnati, it has become the distinguishing
food of the town.  It is just like Philadelphia's cheesesteaks,
Montr√©al's poutine, and Boston's lobster roll.  It defines the town
and is the first thing you do when you get there.  It's also one
outsiders do not always get.  And that is okay, too.  But there is
never any chocolate in it.
