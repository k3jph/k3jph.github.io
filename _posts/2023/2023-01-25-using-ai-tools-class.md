AI tools, such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and
[AI-based art
generation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2023/01/23/midjourney-ai-based-art-generator-creates-dazzling-images-from-words/?sh=78a5ec4f5f61),
are becoming increasingly widely available and accessible to the
general public. With the advancement of technology, these tools are
no longer limited to large research labs and tech companies but are
now available to individuals, small businesses, and educational
institutions. The development of cloud-based platforms and APIs
have made it easier than ever for anyone to access and use these
tools, regardless of their technical expertise or resources.
Additionally, the open-source community has played a significant
role in making these tools available and easy to use for anyone
interested. As a result, the use of AI tools is becoming more and
more prevalent in various fields, from business to education and
art and many more.

While the widespread availability of AI tools can bring many benefits
to education, it also presents certain threats. With the ease of
access to these tools, the temptation to use them for [cheating or
plagiarism may
increase](https://theconversation.com/chatgpt-students-could-use-ai-to-cheat-but-its-a-chance-to-rethink-assessment-altogether-198019).
Additionally, the use of AI tools may also lead to an overreliance
on technology at the expense of critical thinking and problem-solving
skills. Furthermore, the use of AI tools in education could also
perpetuate biases and reinforce existing inequalities if the data
used to train these tools is not diverse and inclusive. Therefore,
it's vital that educational institutions have policies in place to
govern the use of AI tools and make sure they are used ethically
and responsibly, while also providing education on the limitations
and biases of AI tools. This will ensure that the students can make
the most out of these tools while being aware of their [potential
drawbacks](https://accelerationeconomy.com/cxo/future-cxo-minute/why-chatgpt-is-both-overhyped-and-underhyped/).

Students need to learn how to use AI tools appropriately to realize
their potential and avoid potential pitfalls. Learning how to use
these technologies responsibly and ethically will not only help
students to be successful in the classroom but also their future
careers. As AI is becoming an essential part of many industries,
it's essential that students develop the necessary skills to work
with these tools. Additionally, understanding the limitations and
biases of AI tools and being able to evaluate the results they
produce critically is also crucial. With this knowledge, students
will be able to make more informed decisions and be able to use
these tools more responsibly and effectively. Education on the
responsible use of AI tools should be an essential component of any
course or program that uses these technologies.

Students who learn to use AI tools properly will be better prepared
for jobs and life in the 21st century. The ability to work with AI
technologies is becoming increasingly important in many industries,
as they are being used to automate tasks, make predictions, and
analyze data. Having a good understanding of these tools and being
able to use them effectively will give students a competitive edge
in the job market. Furthermore, the skills and knowledge acquired
while learning to use AI tools are not limited to specific industries
but are transferable across many domains. As a result, the students
will be more versatile and adaptable to different job opportunities
in the future. Additionally, being able to use these tools responsibly
and ethically will also prepare them to navigate the rapidly changing
technological landscape and be good citizens in a society increasingly
shaped by AI.

With this in mind, I have added the following to my course syllabus
to encourage the use of AI tools in class but also require they be
used responsibly:

> This course will make use of various AI tools to enhance the learning experience for students. These tools may
> include, but are not limited to, machine learning platforms, language processing tools, and computer vision software.
> Students are expected to use these tools responsibly and ethically, adhering to the guidelines outlined below:
>
> * Students must not use AI tools to cheat or plagiarize.
> * Students must not use AI tools to harass or discriminate against others.
> * Students must respect the terms of service and privacy policies of any AI tools used in the course.
> * Students are encouraged to report any misuse of AI tools to the instructor.
> * Students must not share their login credentials for any AI tools used in the course with others.
> * Students should be aware of the limitations and biases of AI tools and consider them when interpreting results.
> * Students must be able to explain how they used any AI tools and include an explanation with any assignment turned in
>   using AI tools.
> * Students are responsible for learning how to use AI tools effectively. The instructor will provide resources and
>   opportunities for students to learn and practice using these tools, but it is ultimately the student's
>   responsibility to become proficient in their use.
>
> By enrolling in this course, students agree to abide by this policy on AI tools. Any violations of this policy will be
> reported to the appropriate authorities and may result in disciplinary action.

And just to emphasize the point, this policy was based on one written
by ChatGPT.
