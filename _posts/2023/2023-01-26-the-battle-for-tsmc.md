The ongoing [Russian invasion of
Ukraine](https://www.brookings.edu/topic/russias-invasion-of-ukraine/) has
upset more than a few applecarts.  Setting aside the _Idealpolitk_
of the situation, the possibility of Russian success is terrifying
for other reasons.  Those most interested in Russian success are
Xi Jinping and the Chinese state because the lack of direct Western
involvement in Ukraine would be seen to presage direct Western
involvement in a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

[China claims Taiwan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538)
as a part of its territory and has long sought to reunify the island
with the mainland. The Chinese government views Taiwan as a breakaway
province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it back
under its control.

The Chinese government has been pressuring Taiwan in various ways
over the years, including diplomatic isolation, military intimidation,
and economic pressure. The Chinese government has also been actively
seeking to limit [Taiwan's international
recognition](https://www.newsweek.com/which-countries-recognize-taiwan-independence-pelosi-trip-sparks-question-1731428)
and participation in international organizations for decades.

But Taiwan is critical to Western economies because Taiwan is the
home to [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english).  TSMC (Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) is a leading global semiconductor
foundry that designs and manufactures integrated circuits and other
semiconductor devices. It is considered to be one of the most
important companies in the industry because it is the largest
contract chipmaker in the world, providing manufacturing services
for a wide range of customers, including some of the biggest names
in technology, such as Apple, Qualcomm, and Nvidia.

TSMC's advanced manufacturing processes and technologies enable it
to produce chips with smaller geometries, higher performance, and
lower power consumption, which are critical for the development of
cutting-edge technologies such as smartphones, laptops, and data
centers. Additionally, TSMC is a major supplier of chips used in
5G networks, IoT devices, and AI applications, making it a key
player in the development of these emerging technologies.

And suddenly, the United States has moved to block mainland China
from accessing chip manufacturers.  From the [Peterson Institute
for International
Economics](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/national-security-semiconductors-and-us-move-cut-china):

> On October 7, 2022, the Biden administration suddenly restricted
exports of certain equipment and services to Chinese semiconductor
companies. Motivated by national security concerns, the policy aims
to slow the Chinese industryâ€™s ability to produce advanced node
semiconductors.

Now, TSMC has moved from a systemically important business to a
significant geopolitical chip.  And it is possible that China may
have economic and military interests in taking control of TSMC.

Economically, TSMC is a major player in the global semiconductor
industry and controls a significant share of the market for advanced
manufacturing processes. If China were to take control of TSMC, it
could gain access to the company's advanced technologies and
manufacturing capabilities, which could help it to close the gap
with other leading semiconductor-producing nations like South Korea
and the United States. Additionally, it could help China to reduce
its dependence on foreign chipmakers and increase its competitiveness
in the global technology market.

In terms of the military, TSMC's advanced manufacturing processes
and technologies could also be of interest to China's military, as
they are critical for the development of advanced weapons systems
and other military equipment. Having control of TSMC could give
China a strategic advantage in the development and production of
cutting-edge military technology.

If China were to invade Taiwan with taking control of TSMC as a
strategic objective, the risks to Western economies would be enormous.
TSMC is a major supplier of semiconductors and other components to
a wide range of customers, including many leading technology companies
in the United States and Europe. If TSMC were unable to supply these
customers, it could cause a shortage of critical components and
slow down the development and production of new technology products.

This could have a ripple effect throughout the technology industry,
leading to delays and disruptions in the launch of new products,
higher costs for manufacturers, and reduced competitiveness for
companies that rely on TSMC's manufacturing capabilities.

Additionally, many companies have their supply chains dependent on
TSMC, and it could be challenging to find alternative foundries
that are able to match TSMC's level of technology and production
capabilities.

It's worth noting that the global semiconductor industry is highly
competitive, and other semiconductor foundries could potentially
fill the gap left by TSMC. Still, it would take time for them to
ramp up production to meet the demand.  All of this would leave the
[2021-2023 supply chain
crisis](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/research/global-supply-chain-issues)
as a warning of a much worse to come.
