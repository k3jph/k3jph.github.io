In Tuesday’s *Diamondback*, Vince Weaver, while discussing computer viruses, wrote:

> "There are no viruses that affect the Linux or Unix (sic) operating systems. None ... It does not happen."

As a long-time UNIX user, I am sad to state this is grossly untrue. There is nothing in the design of UNIX or Linux which prevents viruses from attacking.

Part of the reason UNIX users are stricken less frequently is because UNIX users tend to know more about how their computer works. They also understand the idiosyncrasies and complexities of systems management.

If others were trained and taught how to handle systems management problems, virus and worm attacks would be fewer and farther between, without needing a fundamental change in the user’s computing paradigm.
