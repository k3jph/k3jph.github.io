Back in December, I did a study on Ebolavirus transmission rates
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Nothing special, but the DRC
outbreak had been going on for just over a year and nobody had
seemed to notice it.  Anyway, it was accepted to JSM, which I just
found out is going virtual this year.  I am not sure how that's
going to work, but as we explore this new world, here we go.  Here's
[the abstract](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=312734):

> This study reviews the 2018-2020 Ebolavirus outbreak in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. Ebolavirus is a viral hemorrhagic
fever principally transmitted via bodily fluids. The mortality rate
among victims is approximately fifty percent. This outbreak is in
the Congolese region of Kivu and across the border in Uganda and
is the second largest outbreak of Ebolavirus recorded. This study
uses daily data on new infections from public data sources to
estimate the basic reproductive number ([latex]R_0[/latex] or
R-nought) for outbreak. The results can be used as part of treatment
and contagion control mechanisms.

The most interesting portion of this is a report that came out of
the [Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/new-ebola-case-emerges-in-congo-just-days-before-who-hoped-to-declare-end-of-outbreak/2020/04/10/047172ee-7b44-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)
last week that after 52 straight days of no new infections, a new
case had popped up.  This is troubling even in good times.  Despite
the world's focus on COVID-19, we cannot forget there are other
dangerous pathogens out there.
