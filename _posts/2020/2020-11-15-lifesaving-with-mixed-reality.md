When disaster strikes, what once was, no longer is; and what is,
is unrecognizable. The ability to understand the way things were
is critical for those working in the response, rescue, and recovery
phases of disaster management, from first responders to insurance
claims agents. A team at the [Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory (APL)](https://www.jhuapl.edu) is developing a system that 
uses 3-D modeling data
and precise positioning data from GPS to display an image of
structures “in place” using a mixed reality head-mounted display
for first responders in a disaster scenario. The proof of concept
revealed significant challenges that need to be solved, and we have
already proposed solutions and are working to test them. This
technology is designed to assist first responders but will also
have applications in other areas that require real-time data
presentation, such as battlefield situational awareness.

I am pleased to have led this team so far and we are quite happy with
our earliest results.  You can read about them in the _[Johns Hopkins 
APL Technical Digest](https://www.jhuapl.edu/Content/techdigest/pdf/V35-N03/35-03-Howard.pdf)_ or check out a brief video of live
results we recorded on campus last year:
