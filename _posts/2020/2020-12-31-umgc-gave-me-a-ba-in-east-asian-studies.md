Well, this is just getting ridiculous, now isn't it?  So, you know,
many years ago, I was playing with YouTube and stumbled across some
video on self-hypnosis.  I couldn't find it now if I had to, but
at the time I had a few minutes to kill, and thought, well, I'll
try anything once.  So I did it.  I am not so sure about hypnosis,
but at the end I had a realization that this is what the mindfulness
people were talking about.  Mindfulness was at the peak of its
corporate adoption nonsense, so I dug a bit more into it.

I found some videos about meditation.  I learned more and more.
But, I am an academic, and I knew we had a course at
[UMGC](https://www.umgc.edu/) about [eastern
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_philosophy).  As
an adjunct, I can take a course here and there tuition-free.  I had
never taken a course in philosophy, but I had a realization that
eastern philosophy will have driven East Asian history, much the
same way western philosophy and Christianity have driven European
and American history.  So I took an East Asian history course first,
and this was a good bet.

Then I took the second half of East Asian history.  And since, you
know, why not, I then took three semesters of Japanese.  Finishing
all of that, it was fairly easy to look at things and realize that
I was three courses and a capstone from finishing a second bachelors
degree in East Asian studies.  And that's how I got this:

But now, I need to clean up that capstone project and prepare it
for publication!  Happy new year to all.
