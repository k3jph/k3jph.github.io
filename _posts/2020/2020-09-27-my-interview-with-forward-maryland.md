Way back in 2018, [Bill Woodcock](https://53beersontap.typepad.com/)
and [Jason Booms](http://spartanconsiderations.blogspot.com/) started
a podcast called [Forward
Maryland](https://53beersontap.typepad.com/forward_maryland/) with:

> Commentary, Opinion and Information about America in Miniature!
This is the blog site for the Forward Maryland audio podcast, video
podcast, live broadcasts, etc.

And it took those guys 133 episodes to have me on the show!  But
they interviewed me on Sunday and we had a great talk about the
[Charter Review Commission](/tag/charter-review) and Tuesday night's
debate, which I have a [good excuse to
miss](https://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals)!

But go listen and remember, this will be on the exam:
