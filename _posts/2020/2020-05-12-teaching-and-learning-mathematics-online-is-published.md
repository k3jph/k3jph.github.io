I am very happy to say [_Teaching and Learning Mathematics Online_
(_TLMO_)](/tlmo) is now available!  This is my fifth book and second
this year (well, both this year were edited volumes, but work with
me here).  I edited this book with [John F.
Beyers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-beyers-ph-d-8948a59),
program director for mathematics and statistics at the [University
of Maryland Global Campus](https://www.umgc.edu/).

Online education has become a major component of higher education
worldwide. In mathematics and statistics courses, there exists a
number of challenges that are unique to the teaching and learning
of mathematics and statistics in an online environment. These
challenges are deeply connected to already existing difficulties
related to math anxiety, conceptual understanding of mathematical
ideas, communicating mathematically, and the appropriate use of
technology.

_TLMO_ bridges these issues by presenting meaningful and practical
solutions for teaching mathematics and statistics online. It focuses
on the problems observed by mathematics instructors currently working
in the field who strive to hone their craft and share best practices
with our professional community. The book provides a set of standard
practices, improving the quality of online teaching and the learning
of mathematics. Instructors will benefit from learning new techniques
and approaches to delivering content.

These issues are suddenly at the forefront of education.  From
kindergarten to university, schools shut down and most educators
were just not ready for this.  We started this way back in 2017,
though, because mathematics and statistics present a special challenge
for online education.  I hope this book can help people stuck in
the middle of this terribly transition.  The [electronic version
is now on Taylor & Francis
eBooks](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351245586).  Due
to complications from COVID-19, the print version will not be
available until the end of June.

Finally, I cannot say enough about the great authors who made this
happen.  Most importantly, though, I want to call out [Mina
Sedaghatjou](https://www.sedaghatjou.com/).  She's taken the lead
in a global presentation series on improving STEM education online
in the wake of COVID-19.  I was fortunate to [give the first talk
in the series](/2020/04/24/the-challenge-of-assessment-and-evaluation-in-online-education/).
