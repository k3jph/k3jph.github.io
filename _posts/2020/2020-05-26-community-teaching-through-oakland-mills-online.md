A few weeks ago, I was invited to talk about Star Wars math, on
[May the Fourth](https://www.starwars.com/star-wars-day) on Oakland
Mills Online.  For this, I did a quick presentation on the line by
Han Solo about the _Millenium Falcon_ making "the Kessel Run in
less than twelve parsecs."  This line has been ridiculed for decades
and occasionally used just to ridicule Han Solo.  But, hey, what
is a parsec?  We can find out from basic trigonometry.  The video
is below, but I didn't do a good job on this one.

What's more important here is that [Oakland Mills
Online](https://www.oaklandmillsonline.com/) is a community-led
learning environment that emerged in response to the school shutdown
amid the COVID-19 crisis.  They are always looking for speakers and
want to find people to talk about math, science, literature, via
Zoom, for an hour or so.  It's awesome, so [sign up if you have
something](https://www.oaklandmillsonline.com/presenter-sign-up.html) to
offer.

And may the Force be with you, always.
