The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted everyone in unforeseeable ways.
From an educational perspective, this pandemic is affecting both
learners and teachers as many countries have suspended their in-person
classes due to the fear of spreading the COVID-19 virus.   STEM
education, in the formal learning environment, is the cornerstone
of our industrial base. Economic growth is predicated on the expansion
of research and development along with the meaningful deployment
of new technologies in business and government. However, STEM
education is typically viewed as both hands-on and higher risk for
distance educators, demanding more intense and more complex
infrastructure than other fields.

Led by [Mina Sedaghatjou](https://www.sedaghatjou.com/), a small
group of us are trying to help STEM instructors who have been forced
to change to online instruction in a hurry.  We will host ten
webinars, each 120 minutes, based on the emerging needs, to assist
and tackle the STEM faculty members’ current concerns. The webinars
are recorded and shared with public and will be free of charge. These
webinars aim to:

1. Facilitate discussions surrounding the teaching members’ challenges; and
2. Foster a community of practice where participants will be able to support each other by sharing their resources and expertise.

Having taught online mathematics courses for 10 years, I gave the
first one focusing on the challenges of assessment and evaluation
in the online classroom, especially in mathematics.  You can view it
