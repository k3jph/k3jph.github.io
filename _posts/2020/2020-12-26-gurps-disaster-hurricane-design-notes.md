This one slipped by me last month.  At the end of last year, _[GURPS
Disaster: Hurricane](/2019/12/19/gurps-disasters-hurricane-released/)_
came out for incorporating hurricanes into your roleplaying games,
and [GURPS](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/) in particular.  [Roger
Bell West](https://tekeli.li/) was one of the playtesters and asked
me if I'd contribute a set of design notes to his e-zine, _The Path
of Cunning_.

Anyway, [it was published in
November](https://tekeli.li/path-of-cunning/tpoc_03.pdf) and includes
some basic notes about why I wrote the supplement, the decisions
made during development, and why.  While you're there, check out
the rest of the website.  There's a lot of good stuff there.
