[Natalie Scala](https://www.drnataliescala.com/) asked me to join a
panel at INFORMS 2020 on electoral
security.  Heading into the 2020 election, many people had expressed
serious concern about the integrity of the election.  While this presentation
is showing after the election, this presentation was recorded a day
_before_ the election.  So prospectively, I made some claims about
how hard it is to hack the election.

And I was right.  Our election integrity is still unmatched, mostly because
of how screwed up the whole system is.  See the slides at [https://jameshoward.us/informs-2020/](https://jameshoward.us/informs-2020/) or watch the 
presentation on YouTube:

This includes a review of how we elect presidents in the United States, since
it is quite complicated and has a lot of moving parts.  Then it goes on to
show why this makes things work for us all.
