[Federal Blockchain News](https://www.federalblockchainnews.com/)
is a new podcast by [John
Stevens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnbstevens/) dedicated to
looking at applications of blockchain in the Federal government.
This is some pretty arcane stuff, even from the standpoint of Federal
IT rules.  But NIST standards are requirements that Federal agencies
must follow under
[FISMA](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act)
when developing new IT projects or modernizing old ones.

John called me up and interviewed me for the second episode of the
new podcast and you can listen to it here on Sticher!
