I am very happy to say my new article, ["Phonetic Spelling Algorithm
Implementations for R," was published in the _Journal of Statistical
Software_](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v095i08), this morning.
This article is the culmination of a few years of work, off-and-on, 
working with phonetic spellign algorithms for 
[record linkage](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/8fm8lo1e/release/2).
The package supports a wide variety of historical and current phonetic
spelling algorithms:

* Caverphone
  * Original Caverphone
  * Caverphone 2
* Cologne (KÃ¶lner)
* Lein
* Match Rating Approach
  * Encoder
  * Comparison
* Metaphone
* New York State Identification and Intelligence System
  * NYSIIS
  * Modified NYSIIS
* Oxford Name Compression Algorithm
* Phonex
* Roger Root
* Soundex
  * Original Soundex
  * Apache Refined Soundex
* Statistics Canada
  * Census Modified

It's been pleasing to see an occasional user send me an email because they
been putting it to use.  It all started because I needed a high-speed
soundex and I just let it grow from there.  This yak may not be shaved
yet.  Maybe a
[version in Rust, next...](https://github.com/k3jph/phonics-in-rust)

_This work used the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery
Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by National Science Foundation
grant number ACI-1548562. In particular, it used the Comet system
at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) through allocations
TG-DBS170012 and TG-ASC150024._
