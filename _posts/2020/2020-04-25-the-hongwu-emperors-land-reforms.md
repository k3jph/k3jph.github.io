The most interesting aspect of the Ming Dynasty governance was its
support for the lower classes.  This was led by the first Ming
ruler, Hongwu Emperor, who started the land reforms. Hongwu realized
that the lower classes had been oppressed by landowners for generations
and wanted to limit peasant abuse.  The land reforms included
[securing property
rights](https://www.persee.fr/doc/etchi_0755-5857_2009_num_28_1_924) in
the Fish Scale Records.  In addition, taxation was apportioned
through the Yellow Register, [the first national census in
China](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25549473).  Together, these
reforms protected small scale farmers from land theft and
disproportionate taxation.  This should be compared to the
[Meiji land restoration](/2018/04/02/meiji-land-reforms-and-modernization)
that took place in Japan five centuries later.

What is interesting, though, is why Hongwu Emperor might have been
interested in protecting the lower classes.  Hongwu, himself, was
born to a peasant family and took part in [peasant riots against
the Yuan
Dynasty](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/CSH0009-4633330328).
This seems to have left an imprint on Hongwu, as [his sayings
included](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/CSH0009-4633330312):

> The poor should have capital. The rich should not annex the
property of others. If a person does usurp more lands just for
oneself and makes the poor be tenant farmers, one then has committed
a crime.

and

> [A] ruler cannot rule for one day without the people, and to
nourish the people, they cannot be without food for one day. Food
comes from the peasants, and the peasantsâ€™ hope lies in the harvest.

We all know that childhood experiences will model the adults we
become.  Hongwu seems to have taken that to an extreme and based
on his own experiences as a peasant, lead the uprising and instituted
land reforms to protect others.
