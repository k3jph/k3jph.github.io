It's important to remember that when Buddhism entered China, it did
not enter a vacuum.  [Like
Japan](/2019/03/02/context-of-japanese-syncretism/), China already
had widespread philosophical traditions.  By the time Buddhism
reached China, [sometime during the first century
CE](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phc3.12209),
Confucianism and Daoism had become widespread in China.  Both had
held great influence over Chinese government.  And beyond these
ideas, [traditional
Shamanism](https://brill.com/view/journals/jeaa/4/1/article-p27.xml)
provided the grounding for Chinese folk religion.

But also like Japan, Chinese religion does not always fit into the
widely understood definition of religion in the West.  These
philosophical traditions were more states of mind and defined how
individuals should interact with each other, without also introducing
supernatural elements.  Being a dedicated practitioner of one
philosophical tradition does not mean you cannot practice another.
This is especially true of Buddhism and Daoism, which appear made
for each other, in some regards.

These two traditions we ripe for syncretism, when two religious
traditions begin to overlay each other and merge into one.  From a
practice perspective, both use meditation to focus the mind, have
similar ethics, and promote kindness to others as a principal virtue.
The two come together and [became Chan
Buddhism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09552367.2013.831606),
which later became Zen in Japan.  This is explored in detail by
[Ray Grigg in _The Tao of Zen_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0785811257).

While neither Buddhism nor Daoism accept supernatural explanations
at their core, both have often developed them in different contexts.
Some [Buddhists expect to be
reincarnated](https://www.pdcnet.org/jipr/content/jipr_2005_0010_0001_0025).
Some Daoists adopted Daoism [in addition to their folk
practices](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0189-2), such
as ancestor worship, spirits, and animism.  Buddhism is not, _prima
facie_, antithetical to these practices.  This environment was ripe
for syncretism and the two practices merged, giving birth to Chan
and other forms of [Mahayana
Buddhism](https://brill.com/view/journals/tpao/66/1/article-p84_3.xml).

Because of this, Buddhism was able to permeate Chinese society
quickly upon introduction.  Of course, Chinese culture also left
its mark on Buddhism, but the ability of each to mould the other
led to easy spread and influence for Buddhism and its practitioners.
