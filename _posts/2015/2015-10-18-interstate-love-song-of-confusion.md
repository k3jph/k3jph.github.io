Going northbound on [U.S. Route 29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_29_in_Maryland), there are two three exits for [Interstate 70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_70_in_Maryland).  The first right-exit goes to eastbound I-70.  The second right-exit goes through a cloverleaf to westbound I-70.  Immediately after the second right-exit is a left-exit that also leads westbound I-70.  

I don't get it, but I bet it makes this guy happy.
