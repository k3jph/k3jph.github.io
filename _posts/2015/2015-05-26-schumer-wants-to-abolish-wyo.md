Senator Chuck Schumer wants to [reform how the NFIP manages policies](http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/05/schumer_wants_fema_flood_insur.html), abolishing the Write Your Own (WYO) system:

> \[The Senator\] proposes that instead of the existing WYO system, the federal government write and issue the policies directly to homeowners.

This would have a few effects.  The most important is that it would remove the insurance agent from the process.  Flood insurance has a notoriously high drop-off rate.  FEMA could probably better enforce the purchase requirement for mortgage holders.  This would be a small step toward reforming the program's finances.
