Over the weekend, I watched "The KGB, the Computer, and Me," a [NOVA](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/) dramatization of [Cliff Stoll's](http://www.kleinbottle.com/) experience chasing down a 75 cent accounting error. I read the book, [The Cuckoo's Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg), back in the 90s, and it's a great book, though the cookies didn't turn out, when I made them. NOVA dramatizes the events fairly well, though Stoll is an interesting narrator.

Someone put the NOVA episode on YouTube, so take an hour and watch it.
