There's an image macro from _[Back to the Future Part II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II)_ showing Griff's gang in the future.  There's an odd helmet, some creepy face tattoos, and what looks like a necklace made of bullet casings.  The macro says that's how we should dress for work today since today is Back to the Future Day.  While my Under Armour jacket is not terribly different from Nogura's, that's not how we should dress for work.  This is how we should dress if we are in a street gang.

The person dressed for an office job is Marty McFly.  His suit may be terribly ugly, but it is also terribly traditional...except for the double ties:
