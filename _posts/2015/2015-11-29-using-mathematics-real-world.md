Science has a good article on [mathematics in industry across the Pacific Rim](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.350.6261.616). The article basically says a lot of mathematicians in manufacturing intense areas are leaving academia (temporarily or permanently) to help improve industrial output. This shouldn't be a surprise, the same thing happened in the West over the last few decades. 

This underlies the important question that math teachers are tired of hearing, "When will I ever use this?" After my first term [teaching statistics at UMUC](/teaching), a student emailed me a slide from a presentation she was watching. It included a 95% confidence interval and a note of surprise that we do this in the real world, too!
