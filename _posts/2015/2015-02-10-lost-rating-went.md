I started playing correspondence chess on the [ICCF](http://www.iccf.com) server's last summer and as you can see from this my rating, I am not that good.  This is especially embarrassing given the fact we are allowed to use chess engines for help.  But that's not important right now.  I received my first official rating coming into 2015 and held a 1682.  Somewhat respectable, but not chessmaster material.  Then this happened.

My first game in the new rating period finished on December 10th with a loss.  So I asked the server to forecast my new rating and my rating went up!  The forecast rating was 1688.  I lost and picked up six rating points.  So how does that happen?

The [Elo rating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) used by the ICCF counts the total difficulty of all the opponents.  [Alexandre Duchardt](https://www.iccf.com/player?id=181274), who beat me, was rated much higher than I was.  He was also rated much higher than my average opponent.  So the net average difficulty went up and those prior few wins were worth just a bit more and the rating goes up.  

For reference, if I predict today, [I score 1722](https://www.iccf.com/player?id=515988).
