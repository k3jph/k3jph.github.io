I got my contract this evening to teach Calculus I at UMUC.  I've [taught almost the entire mathematics sequence](/teaching) over the last 5 years.  But calculus is new to me.  For a long time, I shied away from it.  I think calculus is difficult enough without the problem of trying to teach it online.  But when spring scheduling came up, I asked for it because I wanted to try something new and was looking forward to the challenge.
