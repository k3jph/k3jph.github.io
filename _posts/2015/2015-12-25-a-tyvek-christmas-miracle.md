A couple of years ago, I bought a roll of Tyvek sheeting for a special project.  It was completely the wrong answer for that project, but that's a subject of a different post.

Obviously, I still have the rest of the roll.  We've found it is useful for all sorts of things.  We've used it to protect the dining room table while soldering:

We've used it to protect the table during massive cookie baking exercises this Christmas:

Finally, we used it yesterday to protect the floor for painting.

Tyvek is awesome.  Well, when you actually cover things with it.
