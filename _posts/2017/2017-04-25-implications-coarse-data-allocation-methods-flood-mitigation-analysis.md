I went looking for a copy of my working paper from the [2013 Joint
Statistical
Meetings](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/JSM/2013/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=309271)
and realized, it does not seem to be online.  And neither does my
poster!  So I figured I should fix that.  Here's a link to the
[poster](/assets/docs/JHoward-JSM2013-Poster.pdf)
and the [proceedings
paper](/assets/docs/JHoward-JSM2013-Proceedings.pdf).

The key idea here comes from my work on flood insurance and trying
to understand the county-level effects of flood mitigation grants.
Some grants are given to state agencies.  In other words, the
granularity of reality is insufficient for my goals.  Normally,
it's just a data problem.  So I investigated, briefly, four logical
methods of allocating those grants to local-level jurisdictions to
understand the implications of each.
