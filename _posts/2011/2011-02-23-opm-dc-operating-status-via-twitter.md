A few months ago, I created a [Twitter](http://twitter.com) to automatically announce the DC operating status maintained by the [Office of Personnel Management](http://www.opm.gov) (OPM). This status announces whether or not the Federal government is open or restricted during an emergency. It is most often used to announce snow-related closings and some non-governmental employers rely on this for notifying their employees of weather-related emergencies.. This provides an advantage over other delivery methods provided by OPM in that Twitter can deliver selected user's tweets via a text message.

After testing for a few emergencies with (now) 15 followers, I am ready to announce [@opmdcstatus](https://twitter.com/opmdcstatus) publicly. If anyone at OPM wants to discuss making this more effective and efficient, please contact me.
