> If you find yourself in the Columbia, MD area looking for something to do from 6:30-9pm (January 12th) join the [Columbia Area Linux Users Group](http://www.calug.org) for a great talk from James P. Howard II and Peter M. Van Buren. They will be presenting their talk “[Using DVCS Frameworks for Homogeneous Systems Management](http://calug.org/abstract.html)” to us.
