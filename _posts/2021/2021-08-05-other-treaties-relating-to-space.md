I've talked before about the [Outer Space
Treaty](/2017/08/18/note-outer-space-treaty/) and the framework it
provides for creating subsequent agreements.  This type of work is
not unfamiliar within international law.  Often, broad themes are
laid out in a framework treaty and those are fleshed out into
specifics in later treaties.  Three treaties were signed under the
framework the Outer Space Treaty provides between 1968 and 1974
providing increased resilience and protection for participants in
spaceflight.

The first of these was the [Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts,
the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into
Outer
Space](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/netherlands-international-law-review/article/abs/new-chapter-of-space-law-the-agreement-on-the-rescue-and-return-of-astronauts-and-space-objects/65052CCE07F6E0BFEDDD0AF79AF12CEE)
was signed in 1968.  The Rescue Agreement clarifies provisions of
the Outer Space Treaty's duty to rescue.  The most important aspect
clarifies that anyone in space is entitled to rescue, not just those
sanctioned by a particular government or flight crews.  This has
important applications as [space tourism is taking
off](https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781785361067/9781785361067.00009.xml).
The other major provision of the Rescue Agreement holds that if
space equipment were to land in another nation's territory, the
owner of the equipment could request the equipment be returned and
would compensate the receiving nation for the costs involved.

The second of these is the 1972 [Convention on International Liability
for Damage Caused by Space
Objects](https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jrlsl6&div=20&g_sent=1&casa_token=XUQmjV0CJuUAAAAA:NPvO-ZO5EwB88vaD4AlvGDaeVp1U16m0P9vPCD_fmrZzC3vrH2MC-RMh_3P153rq6TwiOe4&collection=journals),
or the Space Liability Convention.  The Space Liability Convention
clarifies the Outer Space Treaty's liability requirements for damages
caused by spacecraft.  The specific provisions place the liability
for damages on the national from which the spacecraft were launched
from, regardless of who owns the spacecraft or any other mitigating
circumstance.  Further, if two or more nations are responsible for
a spacecraft, then both nations are [jointly and severally
liable](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/joint_and_several_liability).
Despite the limitation on liability to the host nation, joint
responsibility is still possible if a spacecraft were composed of
parts launched from two or more nations, like the International
Space Station has been.  The final clarification is that the treaty
provides no private right of action; all claims must be made by
nations against nations, all signatories to the treaty.  The Space
Liability Convention has only ever been [invoked
once](https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/yjil10&section=11&casa_token=1h4A-xPcpSkAAAAA:RJCEfFsFdOAYm1Cp-_KS4GOmYOFvI0OMFlqnBJq-a6VZpZYw0Xqso_nn1Fp18V_EoZ05CNs)
when the [Soviet Kosmos 954
crashed](https://www.nature.com/articles/277342a0) into Canada's
northern tundra, spreading radioactive debris.

The third treaty was adopted in 1974 and is the [Convention on
Registration of Objects Launched into Outer
Space](https://brill.com/view/book/9789047428794/Bej.9789004175358.i-382_012.xml),
or the Registration Convention.  The Registration Convention requires
that the United Nations [Office for Outer Space
Affairs](https://www.unoosa.org/) maintain a registry of all
spacecraft and that all parties must [submit minimal
information](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576517315138)
such as owner, launch agency, orbital parameters, designation or
name, and "general function" of the spacecraft.  Much more technical
in nature than other treaties under the Outer Space Treaty framework,
this provides critical information that can be used for planning
future space missions as existing orbits can be predicted in advance
using the registration information.

These treaties have provided the most elementary expansions of the
Outer Space Treaty.  Many obvious additions could be made around
issues like right of access, orbital allocations, and assignment
of economic rights to both governments and private actors.  However,
those do not exist under current space law.
