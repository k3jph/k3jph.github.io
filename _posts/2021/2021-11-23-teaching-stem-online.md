Speaking of papers, [Mina Sedaghatjou](https://www.sedaghatjou.com/)
led a group of us across Europe, Canada, and the United States in
a project on teaching STEM online.  At the start of the COVID-19
pandemic, suddenly, all classes were online classes.  And for
teachers not experienced with teaching online, this was a sudden
and drastic change.  Prof Sedaghatjou brought a bunch of people
together to host STEM teaching seminars which are still on YouTube:

Based on these experiences, we wrote the article "Teaching STEM
online at the tertiary level during the COVID-19 pandemic" which
is now available in the _International Journal of Mathematical
Education in Science and Technology_.  Here's the abstract:

> The COVID-19 pandemic not only impacted peopleâ€™s lives globally,
but also pushed faculty to quickly adapt to an online teaching
environment and continue it until the end of the school or academic
year. This study is urgently needed to gain an understanding of the
challenges STEM faculty members face during the COVID-19 era as
they make the transition to teaching online, while many of them
engage in this shift for the first time. The initial results of an
online survey of 101 International STEM faculty members showed that
online evaluation and pedagogy are the most disrupted dimensions
of e-learning when instructors struggled to re-orchestrate their
teaching during such an unprecedented event. In addition, while the
affective domain of teaching is identified as the missing dimension
of an e-learning framework, adoption of the new technology is rated
as the area of least concern for teaching STEM online.
