Our new article "Crystal Cube: Forecasting Disruptive Events" is
now available, gold open access, in _Applied Artificial Intelligence_.
Here's the abstract:

> Disruptive events within a country can have global repercussions,
creating a need for the anticipation and planning of these events.
Crystal Cube (CC) is a novel approach to forecasting disruptive
political events at least one month into the future. The system
uses a recurrent neural network and a novel measure of event
similarity between past and current events. We also introduce the
innovative Thermometer of Irregular Leadership Change (ILC). We
present an evaluation of CC in predicting ILC for 167 countries and
show promising results in forecasting events one to twelve months
in advance. We compare CC results with results using a random forest
as well as previous work.
