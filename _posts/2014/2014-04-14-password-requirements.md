This pretty well sums it up, and everyone's encountering the worst in the wake of [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/). These types of password requirements are misguided and out of proportion. The password for my bank account can be five lower-case letters, but for a genre-films forum hosted by a kid in his parents' basement, it's more complex than the nuclear launch codes.

Now I'm gonna add a gang sign to my password on Twitter.
