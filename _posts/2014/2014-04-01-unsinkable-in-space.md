Wikipedia is a wealth of random trivia. On the [second Mercury mission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Redstone_4 "Mercury-Redstone 4"), Gus Grissom's capsule blew its hatch prematurely and the astronaut nearly drowned, as shown in [_The Right Stuff_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086197/ "The Right Stuff on IMDB"). There are a number of theories about what happened, but they are not important here. When Grissom was later selected as command pilot on Gemini 3, he and pilot John Young named the spacecraft _Molly Brown_, [after a popular musical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unsinkable_Molly_Brown_(musical) "The Unsinkable Molly Brown on Wikipedia"). [Wikipedia sums up what happened next](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Grissom#Naming_of_the_Molly_Brown "Gus Grissom on Wikipedia"):

> NASA publicity officials were unhappy with this name. When Grissom and his pilot John Young were ordered to come up with a new one, they offered _Titanic_. Aghast, NASA executives gave in and allowed the name Molly Brown, but did not use it in any official references. Subsequently and much to the agency's chagrin, on launch CAPCOM Gordon Cooper gave Gemini 3 its sendoff by telling Grissom and Young, "You're on your way, _Molly Brown_!" and ground controllers used this name throughout the flight.

Grissom later died in the [Apollo 1 accident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1 "Apollo 1 on Wikipedia").  The _Molly Brown_ mission patch is shown above.
