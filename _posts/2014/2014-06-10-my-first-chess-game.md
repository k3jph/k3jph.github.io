It's not really my first, but I started playing in tournaments online through the [United States Chess Federation](http://www.uschess.org "United States Chess Federation"), the [Correspondence Chess League of America](http://www.chessbymail.com/ "Correspondence Chess League of America"), and the [International Correspondence Chess Federation](http://www.iccf.com/ "International Correspondence Chess Federation"). I am currently in one tournament sponsored by the CCLA and one by the ICCF. [My first game](http://www.iccf.com/game?id=635144 "Howard vs. Duncovich") ended today with a loss.
