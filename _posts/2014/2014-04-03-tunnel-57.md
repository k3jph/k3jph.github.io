PRI's 99 Percent Invisible tells how Ralph Kabisch dug a tunnel from West Berlin, under the Berlin Wall, to the East, helping 57 East Germans escape to West Berlin in 1964. Kabisch was then a college student in Berlin. After digging Tunnel 57, Kabisch became a transportation engineer constructing transport tunnels around the world.
