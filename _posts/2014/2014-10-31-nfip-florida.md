Seeking Alpha is running a [multipart series on property risk in Florida](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2600335-the-unsustainable-state-of-the-florida-property-insurance-market-part-i). Florida is home to 40 percent of the [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.nfipservices.com/)'s policies, even though it is home to only 5 percent of the population in the United States.
