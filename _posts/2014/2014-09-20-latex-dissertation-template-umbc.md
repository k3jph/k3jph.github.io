The Graduate School at the [University of Maryland Baltimore County](http://www.umbc.edu) provides a [dissertation template](http://www.umbc.edu/graduateschool/etd/latex.html) for graduate students. This template is incomplete and the formatting does not meet the specifications the graduate school puts out. While writing my dissertation, I developed my own style files and template that does meet the Graduate School's requirements. I have made this available:

*   [GitHub repository](https://github.com/howardjp/umbcthesis), with Gitflow
*   [Public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/IL0oRlIz/umbc-thesis-style)

Please use them at UMBC and adapt them to your university as you see fit!
