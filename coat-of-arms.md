At its core, heraldry started as a means of identification, evolving
over centuries from simple insignias to the complex art of designing,
displaying, and studying coats of arms. As we recognize it, the
tradition of heraldry emerged in the early 12th century, primarily
serving the practical purpose of distinguishing combatants who were
otherwise anonymized by their armor on the battlefield. This necessity
gave rise to the role of the herald, individuals who, clad in a
distinctive tabard, were tasked with conveying messages and issuing
challenges for their sovereigns or lords. They were shielded from
harm and armed with extensive knowledge of the armorial symbols
within their jurisdiction and beyond.

Over time, heralds gained the sovereign-backed authority to grant
coats of arms officially. Although the decline of armor in warfare
diminished heraldry's original functional role, it had already
cemented its place within the societal fabric, symbolizing status
and identity far beyond the battlefield. Coats of arms expanded in
scope and were awarded to the aristocracy and notable figures in
society seeking a distinctive form of identification amid widespread
illiteracy.

In the modern era, heraldry has transcended its practical origins
to become predominantly a symbol of prestige and heritage. While
some may attempt to adopt self-styled arms, proper legal recognition
of a coat of arms requires sanctioning by an authoritative body
acting under a mandate from the state. This ensures that heraldry
remains a respected tradition grounded in legitimacy and historical
continuity.

## Heraldry in Malta

The Republic of Malta boasts a rich tapestry of European heraldic
tradition, adorned with coats of arms that narrate the island's
history through its [noble
families](https://santfournier.org/MNINFO/maltesenobilityhistory.html), the
esteemed [Order of St. John](https://www.orderofmalta.int/), and
the ecclesiastical heritage. This heraldic legacy extends to various
institutions, including companies, schools, and corporations, each
bearing unique armorial symbols that contribute to the cultural
mosaic of the Maltese Islands.

{% include figure.html image="Coat-of-Arms-Chief-Herald-Malta.webp"
placement="right" width="40%" cap="Arms of the Office Of the Chief
Herald" alt="Arms of the Office Of the Chief Herald" %}

For a long time, the vibrant array of heraldic emblems across Malta
evolved without the oversight of a central regulatory body. This
changed with the recent establishment of the [Office of the Chief
Herald of Arms of Malta](https://maltaheraldry.mt/), located within
the historic confines of Fort St Elmo in Valletta. [Count Charles
Gauci](https://maltaheraldry.mt/about-us/)'s appointment as the
inaugural Chief Herald of Arms in 2019 marked the beginning of a
new era in Maltese heraldry.

Under the auspices of the Chief Herald of Arms, all newly granted
or registered coats of arms receive official recognition by the
State, ensuring their protection from unauthorized replication. The
Chief Herald's office regulates personal and corporate heraldic
symbols throughout Malta. This includes the creation and grant of
new arms, the registration of long-standing local arms, and the
acknowledgment of arms granted by recognized foreign authorities.

## My Grant of Arms

I received a grant of arms from the Office of the Chief Herald of Arms of Malta,
formalized through Letters Patent numbered G0102, issued on May 1, 2024.  The
formal notice of this grant was published in the _Gazzetta tal-Gvern ta' Malta_,
the official gazette of the Government of Malta, [in issue number 21,194, on
Feburary 16, 2024](/assets/docs/malta-government-gazette-20240216.pdf). This
publication serves as the official record, ensuring transparency and public
acknowledgment of the newly granted arms.

This coat of arms, now officially recorded and recognized, joins a
storied collection of heraldic emblems that reflect the diverse
heritage and dynamic future of Malta. It stands as a symbol of honor
and distinction, offering a lasting legacy that will be cherished
by generations to come.

### Blazon

A blazon is the formal language of heraldry, an intricate system
of symbols and descriptions used for centuries to convey the
composition of coats of arms. It is a precise and codified language
that allows heralds and enthusiasts alike to recreate the visual
splendor of a heraldic shield from textual descriptions alone. Each
term in a blazon specifies colors, patterns, symbols, and placement,
ensuring that the coat of arms can be accurately interpreted and
replicated anywhere in the world.

<div class="row">
  <div class="item col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Argent in pale a tetrahedron Azure pierced in bend by a sword Or with pommel and cross piece of the Second.  Upon a helm befitting his degree with mantling Azure and doubled Or is set for crest, upon a wreath of the liveries a martlet Sable.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="item col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Lewn il-Fidda in Pale tetrahedron lewn Ikħal minfud b'sejf In Bend lewn id-Deheb u bil-maqbad u s-salib tiegħu ta' lewn Ikħal.Fuq elmu li jixraq il-grad tiegħu bid-drappeġġ Ikħal u lewn id-Deheb hemm bħala Kresta fuq girlanda tal-istess ilwien ħuttafa ta' lewn Iswed.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

The blazon presented encapsulates a deeply personal and symbolic
heraldic identity, reflective of both heritage and individual
achievement. At its heart, the argent field sets a stage of purity
and sincerity, upon which a tetrahedron azure is prominently featured.
This geometric figure is not chosen randomly; it is a deliberate
nod to the world of mathematics, representing the bearer's role
within this discipline. The tetrahedron, a solid figure with four
triangular faces, is foundational in geometric studies and serves
as a metaphor for stability and intellectual building blocks,
mirroring the bearer's contributions to and foundations in mathematics.

Piercing the tetrahedron in bend is a sword, or; the seal of Cincinnati,
Ohio, directly inspires its design. This choice links the bearer's
heraldic identity to a significant locale. The imagery of the sword
also evokes the legendary tale of King Arthur's Excalibur, suggesting
themes of nobility, valor, and the destined right to leadership.
The "sword-in-the-stone" allusion enriches the emblem with a narrative
of overcoming challenges to achieve one's rightful place, much like
the mythical king.

    
The crest features a martlet sable, a heraldic charge that holds rich
symbolism within the realm of heraldry. Suggested by Count Gauci, the
martlet's inclusion hints at a lineage likely connecting me to [Thomas
Arundell](https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/thomas-arundell), whose
arms bore six martlets. While the descent remains unproven, the martlet
is a significant symbol in heraldry, often representing continuous quest
and ambition.  Traditionally depicted without feet, the martlet is said
to be in perpetual flight, emblematic of constant endeavor and the
pursuit of higher aspirations. This imagery aligns with the bearer's
journey of discovery and excellence in their field. Therefore, the use
of the martlet is not only a potential nod to ancestral ties but also a
testament to the bearer's tireless dedication and pursuit of knowledge,
embodying the spirit of ambition and the relentless pursuit of
achievement.
            
In addition to incorporating the martlet into the crest of the coat of arms,
I've embraced a unique cross-cultural heraldic approach by creating an image of
the martlet styled as a Japanese _kamon_. 
A _kamon_ is a form of Japanese heraldry, symbolizing family crests or
emblems that date back to the Heian period (794-1185). Traditionally used to
identify family lineage, _kamon_ designs are elegantly simplistic and highly
stylized, often representing animals, plants, or abstract symbols. This
integration of a _kamon_ into the heraldic design not only highlights a blend of
Eastern and Western heraldic traditions but also reflects a personal connection
to the aesthetic and cultural significance of Japanese symbolism. 

### Motto

For a motto, I chose "_Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb_", which is
Maltese for "Only the will leads the heart." This motto underscores
the importance of determination and willpower in guiding one's
passions and decisions, suggesting that true leadership and direction
in life come from inner strength and resolve.

As an aside, Count Gauci suggested this was the first Maltese motto
he had seen in his term of office!

### Emblazonment

An emblazonment in heraldry refers to the artistic representation
of a coat of arms, bringing to life the abstract descriptions of a
blazon through vivid imagery and design. This process transforms
the precise and formulaic language of heraldry into a visual symbol
unique to the bearer, encapsulating their heritage, achievements,
and values. While there may be multiple emblazonments of the same
coat of arms, each with its own stylistic nuances and artistic
interpretations, they are all considered equivalent as long as they
accurately adhere to the details specified in the original blazon.
This principle allows for a rich diversity of heraldic art, where
the essence of the coat of arms remains consistent across different
renditions, showcasing the universal language of heraldry that
transcends individual variations in artistic expression.

### Additional Emblazonments

In this section, we showcase various artistic interpretations of my coat of
arms, highlighting the diversity and creativity within heraldic art. Each
emblazonment, while adhering to the same blazon, brings a unique style and
perspective, reflecting the individual artistry of the creators. These
variations enrich the visual representation of the arms, demonstrating how
heraldry can be both a precise science and a vibrant art form.  By exploring
different emblazonments, we can appreciate the multifaceted nature of heraldic
design and its capacity to convey identity and heritage through various artistic
lenses.

## Related Insignia

Together, the crest, badge, and livery flag form a complete set of
external insignia associated with my armorial bearings. Each serves a
distinct purpose within the broader heraldic tradition: the crest,
placed atop the helm, completes the full achievement; the badge,
rendered in the Scottish strap-and-buckle form, marks personal identity
and armigerous status; and the flag, a vertical tricolor of gold, blue,
and white, displays the livery colors in a form suited for public and
ceremonial use. Though governed by differing conventions--Scottish,
English, Maltese, and beyond--these elements share a unifying function:
to express, in various media and degrees of formality, the continuity
and presence of heraldic identity.

### Crest

{% include figure.html image="armory/jhoward-crest-quentin-peacock.svg" width="4"
placement="right" cap="Crest in the Fairbairn-style by [Quentin Peacock](https://www.digitalheraldry.com/)"
alt="Crest in the Fairbairn-style by Quentin Peacock" %}

The crest occupies its traditional position atop the helm in the full armorial
achievement and serves as a complementary emblem of personal identity. In this
case, it is a martlet Sable—rendered footless, in flight, and facing dexter—set
upon a wreath of the livery colors. Unlike the shield, which often functions
independently in banners or seals, the crest is more intimate in scale and
symbolic depth, used most often in formal armorial contexts or engraved devices.

The design shown here was drawn by [Quentin
Peacock](https://www.digitalheraldry.com/) and follows the stylistic conventions
of [Fairbairn's Book of
Crests](https://archive.org/details/fairbairnsbookof01fair/page/n5/mode/2up),
one of the most influential heraldic reference works of the 19th and early 20th
centuries. First published in 1859 and continually expanded thereafter,
Fairbairn's compilation became a de facto visual standard for how British and
colonial crests should be illustrated: compact, crisp, and uniform in treatment,
with an emphasis on legibility and heraldic clarity. The illustrations are often
set without background, with consistent line work, minimal shading, and a
careful focus on the recognizable outline of each charge. In this style, the
martlet appears as a clean black silhouette on a simple torse—a deliberate
homage to Fairbairn's aesthetic and its influence on modern armorial
presentation.

In that spirit of familiarity, the martlet has also been given a name: Eckbert.
This bit of informal personification arose during the design process between
Quentin and myself, and while not heraldically required, it reflects the
personal dimension that crests often hold. They are not just visual identifiers,
but symbolic avatars—distillations of lineage, values, and character.

The blazon of the crest reads:

> Upon a wreath of the liveries a martlet Sable

Though spare, this is a classically structured English blazon. The martlet, long
associated with tireless pursuit, intellectual restlessness, and the role of the
younger son, is rendered here in black to signify constancy, wisdom, and
measured reserve. The torse, bearing azure and or (blue and gold), links the
crest visually and symbolically to the shield, ensuring that the entire
achievement reads as a coherent whole.

In contemporary use, the crest may appear above the arms on letterheads,
documents, and regalia, or on its own when the context calls for a simplified
emblem. In such settings, Eckbert—the sable martlet—serves not only as a visual
anchor, but as a quiet representative of the ideals behind the arms: learning,
discipline, and a certain restless precision.

### Banner

{% include figure.html image="armory/jhoward-banner.svg" width="4"
placement="right" cap="Heraldic banner adapted from the arms"
alt="Heraldic banner adapted from the arms" %}

The heraldic banner is a square flag displaying the shield alone, rendered at
full size and in proper proportions. Unlike a standard, which includes multiple
armorial components and a tapering shape, the banner reproduces only the
escutcheon. This makes it the most literal and direct translation of the arms
into flag form, following longstanding heraldic convention. The banner is
typically used in static and ceremonial settings, such as processions,
investitures, academic convocations, or indoor displays, where the design can be
seen clearly and appreciated up close.

The blazon of the banner is:

> A banner of the Arms

This format omits helm, crest, mantling, and motto, in keeping with the
convention that banners reflect only the contents of the shield. By excluding
all external additaments, the banner places visual and symbolic emphasis on the
core of the armorial identity. In my case, this includes the mathematical symbol
of the tetrahedron and the golden sword inspired by the civic seal of
Cincinnati, elements that signify structure, intellect, and heritage.

The banner's square proportions (1:1) also distinguish it from other heraldic
flags, such as standards or guidons. It is not meant to be flown from a pole in
the open air, but rather presented in still environments, hung vertically from a
balcony, mounted on a wall, or carried in procession. This controlled setting
allows for a more intimate viewing of the arms and supports their use as a
formal emblem of identity.

### English Heraldic Badges

<div id="masonry-container" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-4 col-4 pull-right"> 
{% include figure.html placement="right" 
image="armory/jhoward-heraldic-badge.svg" 
cap="Primary heraldic badge" 
alt="Primary heraldic badge" %}

{% include figure.html placement="right"
image="armory/jhoward-heraldic-badge-crossed-swords.svg"
cap="Secondary heraldic badge variant"
alt="Secondary heraldic badge variant" %}
</div>

Two heraldic badges are associated with my armorial bearings, each combining
core elements from the arms into compact, emblematic forms. These badges follow
the tradition of English armory, where personal devices were historically used
for identification in less formal or non-armorial contexts—appearing on
retainers’ clothing, seals, standards, household plate, and architecture.

The primary badge features the martlet from the crest placed in front of a
vertically oriented sword inverted, drawn directly from the shield. This
combination merges the symbolic meanings of the arms: the sword represents
resolve and order; the martlet, constant inquiry and pursuit. In uniting them,
the badge becomes a singular emblem of philosophical direction under principled
discipline.

The blazon of the primary badge is:

> A sword inverted Or hilted Azure surmounted by a martlet Sable.

This badge was adopted following the grant of arms issued by the Chief Herald of
Arms of Malta and remains heraldically consistent with the granted design,
though not part of the Letters Patent itself. It follows English custom in that
badges may be assumed or developed alongside armorial bearings, especially when
drawn exclusively from components already granted.

The secondary badge features a blue tetrahedron—the central geometric figure
from the shield—surmounted by two golden swords in saltire. This design is more
assertive and structured, and lends itself well to institutional, martial, or
ceremonial uses. Where the first badge emphasizes symbolic integration, this
variant focuses on balance and strength.

The blazon of the secondary badge is:

> A tetrahedron Azure surmounted by two swords in saltire Or, hilted Azure.

Both badges are designed for flexibility and visual clarity. They may be used in
various heraldic and para-heraldic settings: engraved objects, wax seals,
digital avatars, or rendered in precious metal for regalia. Though unofficial in
the legal sense, their derivation from the armorial bearings and adherence to
heraldic norms establish their legitimacy as extensions of the granted arms.

### Scottish Crest Badge

{% include figure.html width="4" placement="right"
image="armory/jhoward-crest-badge-member.svg" 
cap="Crest in the form of a crest badge" 
alt="Crest in the form of a crest badge" %}

The Scottish crest badge, traditionally worn as a cap badge,
incorporates elements from my personal crest within a strap and buckle
design, an emblematic format that communicates loyalty and fidelity.
This design is not merely decorative; it is steeped in the legal and
symbolic framework of Scottish heraldry. In its classic form, the
strap-and-buckle encircles the crest of a clan chief and bears the
chief's motto, signifying allegiance from the wearer to that chief. In
more recent times, armigers, those granted arms in their own right, have
adapted this form to display their own crests, thereby signifying
personal armigerous status and independent heraldic authority.

The origins of the crest badge lie in the clan system of the Scottish
Highlands, where the chief's crest and motto functioned as visual
shorthand for the collective identity of the clan. Members of the clan,
though not necessarily armigers themselves, would wear the chief's crest
within a belt and buckle to declare their loyalty. This practice was
codified by the Court of the Lord Lyon, Scotland's heraldic authority,
which regulates not only the grant and use of arms but also their
display. It is thus not only a cultural tradition, but a practice
grounded in heraldic law. For armigers, the adaptation of the badge to
include their own crest represents a proud assertion of personal
identity within the broader heraldic community.

The central element of my own Scottish crest badge is the martlet,
depicted without feet, which traditionally symbolizes ceaseless effort
and the pursuit of higher goals. The martlet's perpetual motion, never
able to land, embodies the idea of continual striving, a reflection of
personal ambition and moral resilience. Encircling the martlet is a belt
bearing the motto "_Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb_," which in Maltese
means "The will must guide the heart." This phrase, personal in origin
and meaning, pairs naturally with the image of the martlet, both
emphasizing inward resolve and the search for ethical direction.

{% include figure.html width="4" placement="right"
image="armory/jhoward-crest-badge-armiger.svg"
cap="Crest in the form of an armiger's crest badge"
alt="Crest in the form of an armiger's crest badge" %}

My badge also includes a feather, a distinctive mark in Scottish
heraldry that denotes the bearer as an armiger. This usage has evolved
from the tradition by which clan members without arms might wear a
single feather behind their badge when attending in support of their
chief. An armiger, however, may bear a single feather in their badge
design to signify independent armigerous status, visually setting them
apart from clansmen who are not entitled to arms. In this context, the
feather functions as both a heraldic and social indicator, affirming
that the wearer has been formally recognized by the Lord Lyon as bearing
arms in their own right.

The belt and buckle motif is not arbitrary. Its circular form denotes
unity and continuity, while the buckle represents security,
steadfastness, and the binding nature of oaths. When this design is worn
around the crest of another, such as a clan chief, it marks deference
and fealty. When worn with one's own crest, it marks a complete and
lawful identity within the heraldic tradition. The shape and symbolism
thus reinforce the meaning of the badge: a unity of personal arms with
traditional loyalty, enclosed and secured by the emblems of honor.

In my own badge, the strap-and-buckle format not only frames the
martlet, feather, and motto, it draws them together into a unified
visual language. The result is an emblem that expresses individual
aspiration, the legal dignity of armigerous rank, and an inherited
fidelity to the ideals of Scottish heraldic tradition. It is, in that
sense, both a personal and cultural declaration, one that honors the
past even as it presses forward, like the martlet, into the future.

### Standard

{% include figure.html width="4" placement="right"
image="armory/jhoward-standard.svg"
cap="The standard"
alt="The standard" %}

A heraldic standard is a long, tapering flag that serves as a personal or
familial ensign, especially appropriate for armigers with crests and badges.
Unlike a banner, which displays the arms alone, a standard integrates multiple
heraldic elements into a cohesive and ceremonial whole. Its primary purpose is
to signal identity in a public or military setting, not just through arms, but
through livery colors, motto, and emblematic devices. Historically, standards
were used in procession, in battle, and at tournaments, where they marked
allegiance, presence, and prestige.

My own standard follows this tradition. The hoist bears the arms of Maryland,
that is, the quartered arms of the Calvert and Crossland families, emblematic of
the Barons Baltimore and the colonial proprietorship from which Maryland takes
its name. This placement, known as the hoist of allegiance, declares personal
loyalty to a geographic or feudal authority, rather than to a royal house. In
the context of a standard, it traditionally signified the liege lord or
political body to which the armiger owed allegiance. In my case, it honors both
historical continuity and my family's deep Maryland roots.

The full blazon of the standard is as follows: 

> A standard, the hoist bearing the arms of Maryland; the fly per fess Argent,
charged with the Crest between two representations of the Badge, all separated
by two bends Azure inscribed with the Motto in letters Argent

The fly of the standard is designed to bring together the principal components
of my armorial bearings in a dynamic and legible form suited to cloth. The
Crest, set prominently between two versions of the personal Badge, anchors the
visual composition. The bends inscribed with the Motto (_Ir-rieda biss tmexxi
l-qalb_) provide both literal and symbolic connection between these elements. The
overall design reflects a deliberate balance between personal identity and
public allegiance, offering a visual statement that is both traditional and
uniquely mine.

Although not included in the original grant of arms issued by the Chief Herald
of Arms of Malta, this standard was developed and adopted subsequently in
accordanc  e with established heraldic practice. It remains consistent with the
armorial bearings granted under Maltese authority and serves as a lawful and
appropriate extension of their use in flag form.

### Kamon

{% include figure.html image="armory/jhoward-kamon.svg" width="4" placement="right"
cap="Kamon adapted from the coat of arms by [Leonardo Barbosa da Silva](https://x.com/dev_cid)" 
alt="Kamon adapted from the coat of arms by Leonardo Barbosa da Silva" %}

This kamon (かもん) is a modern creation, inspired by my existing coat
of arms but developed independently through collaboration with several
artists and designers familiar with Japanese heraldic tradition. It
draws from the motif known as けんむすびかりがね (剣結び雁金), a
combination of stylized wild geese (かりがね, 雁金) and sword knots or
blades (けん, 剣). The final form includes three birds interwoven with
blades in a pattern that is both elegant and unprecedented in
traditional mon (もん) surveys, according to experts I consulted.

While kamon (かもん) historically emerged as family identifiers during
Japan's Heian period, they have always left room for aesthetic
innovation, especially in modern reinterpretations. This design does not
reflect any existing Japanese family emblem but is instead a thoughtful,
respectful fusion of form and meaning, an abstract representation that
nods toward both martial symbolism and migratory grace.

To me, the arrangement of the elements, three geese and three swords,
each spaced 60 degrees apart, suggests movement, balance, and symbolic
interplay. The design alternates かりがね (雁金) and けん (剣) in a
circular configuration, such that a goose sits at the top and a sword
anchors the bottom. This symmetry creates a sense of poise and quiet
dynamism. While the symbolism is personal and interpretive, the
rotational balance and alternating motifs give the かもん (家紋) a
feeling of motion and intention, expressive without being literal.

This kamon (かもん) is not a replacement for my coat of arms, but rather
a sibling to it, a cross-cultural expression rooted in dialogue, design,
and a shared appreciation for heraldic language.

### Flag

{% include figure.html image="armory/jhoward-flag.svg" width="4" placement="right" border=true
cap="Flag adapted from the liveries of the arms" 
alt="Flag adapted from the liveries of the arms" %}

The flag of my liveries is composed of three vertical stripes of equal
width, arranged from hoist to fly in the order gold, blue, and white.
This tricolor format offers a clean, modern articulation of the livery
colors drawn from my armorial bearings. It is not a banner of arms and
does not replicate any heraldic charges; rather, it serves as a livery
flag, a visual marker of affiliation, presence, and identity.

Unlike traditional banners of arms, which transcribe the shield directly
into flag form, the livery flag is more flexible in use. It may be flown
in both formal and informal contexts, serving as a field sign, household
standard, or traveling emblem. Its purpose is to convey recognition, not
blazon: a coherent expression of the armiger's established colors,
suitable for display where the full achievement might be impractical or
excessive.

The vertical arrangement offers a balanced and dignified aesthetic,
consistent with both heraldic and vexillological principles. Though the
colors themselves do not carry specific symbolic meaning apart from
their use in the arms, their combination is distinctive and immediately
recognizable. When rendered in cloth or drawn in miniature, the
gold–blue–white tricolor serves as a quiet but unmistakable extension of
heraldic presence.

In this way, the flag complements the crest, badge, and full
achievement: not by repeating their form, but by reinforcing their
identity through color and proportion. It is a modern continuation of
livery tradition, designed for clarity, defined by lineage, and carried
forward with fidelity.

### Cockade

{% include figure.html image="armory/jhoward-cockade.svg" width="4" placement="right"
cap="Cockade adapted from the liveries of the arms" 
alt="Cockade adapted from the liveries of the arms" %}

Complementing the coat of arms, I have adopted a distinctive heraldic cockade, a
traditional decorative rosette historically used to symbolize allegiance,
affiliation, or identity. Often worn on hats or uniforms, cockades have a rich
tradition in heraldry and carry symbolic significance.

My personal heraldic cockade consists of three concentric circles in white,
blue, and gold, arranged from the outside to the center. These colors mirror
those prominently featured in my coat of arms. Together, the cockade and coat of
arms visually reinforce my personal and heraldic identity, bridging symbolism
from both tradition and personal heritage.

Together, the harmonious arrangement of these colors reinforces a balanced blend
of heritage, individual values, and an appreciation of intercultural
connections. By incorporating this cockade alongside my coat of arms, I
emphasize not only my personal identity but also the timeless unity of
meaningful symbolism across diverse cultures.

### Tartan

In addition to the arms granted to me by the Chief Herald of Arms of Malta, I
have registered a personal tartan with the Scottish Register of Tartans.
Entitled the James Howard & Family (Personal) tartan, it was officially entered
into the Register on 27 May 2025 under [registration number
14,834](/2025/05/26/a-new-tartan).

The thread count is:

> DB/36 DY4 Y8 DY4 DB36 B28 LB20 W/8

This tartan draws its palette directly from the heraldic colors of my coat of
arms. While the colors do not carry individual symbolic meaning, they
collectively serve to reinforce the visual identity already established in
armorial form. Rendered in deep blues, golds, and white, the design expresses
continuity between textile and shield ,  a wearable complement to the armorial
tradition.

The aesthetic of the tartan is best described as modern ceremonial: it shares
affinities with regimental and academic tartans, but is grounded in personal
heraldry rather than institutional use. Though formally contemporary, its
composition evokes the balance and dignity of historical patterns. The staff at
the Register were both courteous and efficient, making the registration process
an absolute pleasure.

This tartan is reserved for personal and family use. Friends and extended kin
are welcome to wear it respectfully, particularly in heraldic or ceremonial
contexts.

## Additional Registrations

While the coat of arms is formally granted by the Chief Herald of Arms of Malta,
additional recognitions help reinforce its presence and legitimacy across
heraldic jurisdictions. These registrations reflect the broader armorial
ecosystem in which heraldry operates today.

### Duplicate Grant (Alternative Format)

The Chief Herald of Malta also issued a second version of the grant in an
alternative physical format. While the original is a large-format, A2-sized
sheet suitable for framing and ceremonial display, the alternate version is
presented as a series of standard A4 pages, formally bound in a presentation
binder. This version is heraldically identical in content, containing the same
blazon, legal language, and official certification, but differs in its physical
layout, typography, and purpose. The multi-page format lends itself to archival
storage, practical handling, and reference consultation, rather than ornamental
display.

This dual-format approach reflects the hybrid character of the Maltese heraldic
office. As a relatively recent institution within a civil law jurisdiction, the
Chief Herald of Malta combines symbolic functions inherited from British and
European heraldic traditions with modern documentary practices more typical of
notarial or governmental registries. Issuing both a display grant and a
documentary edition allows for continuity with ceremonial expectations while
ensuring the grant serves its administrative and legal roles within the state's
framework.

Comparable systems exist elsewhere, Scotland's Court of the Lord Lyon issues
both Letters Patent and entries in the Public Register, and the Canadian
Heraldic Authority often separates artistic rendering from the text of the
instrument, but Malta's solution is distinctive for integrating both functions
under one authority with two physically distinct outputs. This reflects an
appreciation for both the performative and practical roles heraldry plays in a
modern civic context.

### American Armigers

The arms have also been formally recorded by the [American Armigers
Register](https://americanarmigers.us/), a private society dedicated to
recognizing and documenting legitimate armorial bearings used by individuals in
the United States. The Register provides a public-facing directory of American
armigers, affirming their heraldic identity within a domestic cultural context.
It does not confer arms, but rather acknowledges existing rights to arms by
grant, matriculation, or longstanding use, and promotes responsible heraldic
practice in the American tradition.

The record for James P. Howard, II includes the arms granted by the Chief Herald
of Arms of Malta, preserving the blazon in English heraldic terminology and
listing the crest and motto as well. The motto, _Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb_
(“Only the will moves the heart”), appears in both the original Maltese and in
spirit with the rest of the armorial arrangement.

Although the website has not yet been updated to reflect the new registration,
the certificate, issued under Registration Number AA0183 and dated, 20 June
2025, is available below.
