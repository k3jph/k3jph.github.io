I am a data scientist at the [Johns
Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory](http://www.jhuapl.edu/).
Previously, I have been a
consultant to various government agencies, including the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Executive Office of the President, and
the United States Department of Homeland Security. Before that,
I served as an internal consultant on scientific computing
for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Alongside my professional work, I have a strong passion for teaching
and have been teaching mathematics and statistics at the University
of Maryland Global Campus since 2010. I have also taught public
affairs at several institutions, including the City University of
New York and the 
[University of New Mexico](https://jphoward.people.unm.edu/).

I consider myself [fortunate to have played a part in many innovative
projects throughout my career](/scholarship), which include modeling
the spread of infectious respiratory diseases and Ebolavirus,
predicting global disruptive events, researching blockchain for
government services, and designing devices to rescue victims of
building collapse. I have also authored [two books](/books/) on my
work and co-edited two more.

In my free time, I'm an active member of my community, having served
[Howard County, Maryland](/service/howard-county) in various roles
including as a member of the Board of Appeals and Charter Review
Commission. I've also volunteered my time providing economic advice
to the [Columbia Association](http://www.columbiaassociation.com/),
establishing an alumni association for the [College Park Scholars
Program](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland,
and serving on several public and private boards.
