The [Society of Civil War Families of
Ohio](https://www.ogs.org/about/lineage/scwfo/) (SCWFO) is a lineage society
under the [Ohio Genealogical Society](https://www.ogs.org) (OGS), dedicated to honoring the descendants
of Civil War veterans who served Ohio during the conflict. Membership in SCWFO
acknowledges a family's direct connection to the state's Civil War history,
ensuring that the contributions of these veterans and their descendants are
remembered and preserved.

## Private Thomas Wesley Newman

Private [Thomas Wesley Newman](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Newman-16570)
served in the [79th Ohio Volunteer
Infantry](http://www.ohiocivilwar.com/cw79.html), Company H, during the Civil
War. His service was brief and lead to a disability discharge at Columbus, Ohio,
on November 5, 1862. The family's connection to him is traced through
[collateral descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(kinship)) from
his brother, [Benjamin Franklin
Newman](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Newman-16481), reflecting the broader
legacy of the Newman family's contributions during this pivotal period in
American history.
