The [Hereditary Society of
Teachers](https://www.hereditarysocietyofteachers.org) is the only
hereditary society dedicated to honoring educators across the centuries.
Founded in 2010, the Society recognizes the contributions of teachers
who have shaped the boundaries of education in what is now the United
States. Membership in this society celebrates the legacy of educators
who have made a lasting impact on their communities.

## Mary Jane Cavender

[Mary Jane Cavender](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cavender-523), born
on October 14, 1918, in Bradford, Ohio, is my maternal grandmother and the
basis for my acceptance into the Hereditary Society of Teachers. Mary
Jane dedicated her life to teaching third grade in the 20th century,
humorously noting that she kept returning because she "never managed to
pass it herself." Her lighthearted approach to education turned what
might have been a personal setback into a passionate commitment to
helping countless students navigate their learning journeys.

Mary Jane's dedication to education is emblematic of the values upheld
by the Society--recognizing the importance of teachers in shaping the
minds and futures of their students. Her long-standing contribution to
education forms a significant part of our family legacy, and being able
to honor her through this society is deeply meaningful.

## A Family of Educators

Education runs deep in our family. I am honored to continue the legacy
as a teacher myself. My mother, Mary Jane Cavender’s daughter, was also
a teacher, as was my great-grandmother, Mina Hall (Mary Jane Cavender's
mother). My father taught in the evenings when I was a child. This
deep-rooted commitment to education, passed down through multiple
generations, is a testament to the belief in the transformative power of
teaching.

## About the Hereditary Society of Teachers

The Hereditary Society of Teachers was founded with the intent to honor
men and women who taught within the boundaries of what is now the United
States, along with their descendants. The Society encourages
genealogical and historical research, promotes camaraderie among
members, and fosters the recognition of outstanding teachers.

The organization's commitment is reflected in its bylaws, which
articulate the Society’s purpose:

> The object of this Society shall be to honor all men and women who
> taught in what is now considered the boundaries of the United States
> of America and those teachers' descendants; to promote genealogical
> and historical research; encourage camaraderie among the members and
> those of like pursuit; and to encourage the recognition of outstanding
> teachers.

This mission is embodied in the Society's motto, *"How can I learn, lest
someone should teach me."* (Acts 8:31)

## Categories of Membership

Membership in the Hereditary Society of Teachers can be established
through any ancestor who taught in the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, or 21st
century within the United States. New members may join based on a lineal
ancestor, while current teachers can submit supplemental applications to
honor their own contributions to education.

## Legacy

My acceptance into the Hereditary Society of Teachers allows me to honor
the legacy of Mary Jane Cavender, whose life exemplified dedication to
teaching. It also honors the broader legacy of my family of educators,
including my mother, great-grandmother, and father, each of whom made
their own contributions to the field of education. Preserving these
memories is a testament to the importance of recognizing those who have
devoted themselves to shaping minds and fostering growth.

*Additional memberships will be added as they are approved.*
