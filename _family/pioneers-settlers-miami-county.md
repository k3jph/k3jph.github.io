County](https://sites.rootsweb.com/~ohmchgs/mchgs_recognition.html)
lineage society recognizes the descendants of individuals who resided in

## William Henry Harrison Martin, Vincent Martin, and Mary Stiles

[William Henry Harrison
Martin](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Martin-86990), born in Covington,
Miami County, in 1841, qualifies for membership in this society, along
with his parents, [Vincent
Martin](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Martin-86975) and [Mary
Stiles](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Stiles-5358).  William's birth in
1841 serves as proof of his parents’ residency in the county during this
time, making them eligible for inclusion as pioneers of Miami County.

Vincent Martin and Mary Stiles established their family in Covington during a period of growth in the region. Their son’s birth further solidifies the family’s presence in Miami County, contributing to the early development of the area.

This membership highlights the pioneering spirit of families like the Martins, who lived in the county during its formative years.
