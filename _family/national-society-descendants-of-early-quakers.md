The [National Society Descendants of Early Quakers](http://www.earlyquakers.org)
(NSDEQ) honors the legacy of the early Quakers who helped shape American
society, through both their advocacy for peace and their contributions to
community building. Membership in NSDEQ acknowledges the significance of these
ancestors and celebrates their values, which continue to resonate today.

## Jonathan Newman

[Jonathan Newman](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Newman-16493), born on 8 December
1768 in Chatham County, North Carolina, is my direct ancestor and the basis for
my acceptance into NSDEQ. Jonathan was an early Quaker whose life journey took
him from the South to Warren County, Ohio, where he and his family established
roots in the burgeoning communities of the Midwest.

Jonathan's marriage to Anne Cloud in 1797 at the [Rocky River Meeting
House](https://www.rockyriverfriendsmeeting.org/) in Chatham County exemplifies
the close-knit and supportive nature of Quaker communities at that time. This
union was well-documented in Quaker meeting records, contributing to the
verification of my lineage for NSDEQ membership.

## Other Early Quaker Ancestors

In addition to Jonathan Newman, my family tree includes several other early
American Quakers, each of whom played an important role in the development of
their communities:

- **Marmaduke Coate**: A prominent member of the Quaker community in New Jersey
  and Pennsylvania, Marmaduke Coate's dedication to the principles of the
  Society of Friends helped shape the early settlements in these regions.
- **Joseph Coppock**: Active within the Quaker faith, Joseph Coppock was a
  steadfast supporter of Quaker values and contributed to the growth of the
  faith in the American colonies. His legacy lives on through his descendants,
  who continued to practice and promote Quaker beliefs.
- **William Cloud**: One of the earliest settlers in Pennsylvania, William Cloud
  arrived in the late 17th century as part of William Penn's initiative to
  establish a Quaker refuge. His involvement in the community demonstrates the
  pioneering spirit and resilience of early Quaker settlers.
- **Alexander Underwood**: An early Quaker minister, Alexander Underwood was
  deeply involved in the spiritual life of his community, spreading the
  teachings of the Society of Friends. His contributions reflect the commitment
  and steadfastness of early Friends in establishing peaceful and principled
  communities.
- **Ellis Pugh**: A noted Quaker minister and author, Ellis Pugh's influence
  extended beyond his community as he helped spread Quaker teachings through his
  writings. His dedication to the faith provides a significant link to the rich
  history of Quaker spirituality and ministry.

These individuals are part of a broader Quaker heritage that deeply influenced
the trajectory of my family, linking us to the history and values of the Society
of Friends. Their commitment to peace, equality, and community continues to
inspire the present-day exploration of our lineage.

## About the National Society Descendants of Early Quakers

The National Society Descendants of Early Quakers was founded on September 10,
1980, to honor and preserve the legacy of Quaker ancestors. The society began
over a simple dinner conversation where the idea of a hereditary society for
early Quakers was presented to Dr. and Mrs. Clifton R. Brooks and Lloyd F.
Wheeler. It was through the organizing abilities of Agnes Brooks and the
dedication of founding members that NSDEQ took shape and grew into the vibrant
organization it is today.

NSDEQ's mission is to recognize and celebrate the values of the early
Quakersâ€”nonconformists who endured persecution but thrived in adversity,
becoming known for their fairness and tolerance of others' beliefs. Founded
during a period of religious and political turmoil in mid-17th century England,
the Quaker movement, led by [George
Fox](https://www.georgefox.edu/about/history/quakers.html), emphasized the
"[Inner Light](https://quaker.org/the-inner-light/)" and spiritual truth.
Quakers spread throughout the British Isles, Germany, and the American colonies,
and their influence remains impactful to this day.

The NSDEQ preserves this important heritage, providing members with
opportunities to learn about their Quaker ancestors and to contribute to the
historical record. The society's journal, *Plain Language*, documents member
lineages and explores the lives of early Quakers. The NSDEQ fosters community
among its members through annual events and publications, ensuring that the
story of early American Quakers continues to be told.

## Additional Recognized Ancestors

Jonathan Newman is not the only Quaker ancestor recognized by NSDEQ. During the
application process, it was identified that Joseph Newman (Generation 6) and
Anne Cloud (Generation 7) are eligible for "streaker" supplemental applications.
These supplementals, which require minimal additional documentation, could
further expand my recorded connection to the legacy of early American Quakers.

## Legacy

Jonathan Newman's contribution to the Quaker movement and his role in the
migration to Ohio provide a glimpse into the spiritual and community-driven
values of my ancestors. My acceptance into NSDEQ honors this enduring legacy,
ensuring that the stories of Jonathan and his family are preserved for future
generations, and that their values remain part of our collective heritage.

*Additional memberships will be added as they are approved.*
