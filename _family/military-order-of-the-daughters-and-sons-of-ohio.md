The [Military Order of the Daughters and Sons of Ohio
(MODSO)](https://www.ogs.org/about/lineage/modso) is a lineage society
dedicated to honoring and preserving the legacy of Ohio residents who
served in the armed forces of the United States or the British colonial
forces before the American Revolutionary War.  As part of the [Ohio
Genealogical Society](https://www.ogs.org/), MODSO recognizes
individuals who can prove descent from these servicemen and women. The
society's mission is to celebrate and document the contributions of
these military ancestors, ensuring their sacrifices and stories are
remembered for future generations.

## Ralph Everett Rees

One of member of my family who qualifies for recognition by MODSO is my
maternal grandfather, [Ralph Everett
Rees](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rees-4585). Ralph served in the
[Army of the United
States](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Army_of_the_United_States)
during World War II. His service began with a [deployment to North
Africa](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/allied-military-operations-in-north-africa),
but as Axis forces led by Rommel were retreating, he was redirected and
retrained as a paratrooper. On his [first jump over
Sicily](https://www.asomf.org/airborne-operations-in-sicily-operation-husky/),
Ralph was shot in the leg by a Nazi soldier. He endured 12 months as a
prisoner of war before being transferred to a military hospital in Long
Island, New York. Following his recovery, Ralph returned to Troy, Ohio,
where he worked for [The Hobart Manufacturing
Company](https://www.hobartcorp.com/). After retiring, he pursued
farming in nearby Casstown.

My membership in MODSO allows me to honor Ralph's bravery and resilience
while supporting the society's mission of preserving Ohio's rich
military history. Through this membership, I aim to contribute to the
recognition and appreciation of the countless Ohioans whose service and
sacrifices have shaped our nation's history.
