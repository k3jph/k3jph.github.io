dedicated to honoring the descendants of individuals who have lived in Paulding
County for at least 100 years. Membership in CFPC acknowledges a family's
enduring connection to the county's history, preserving the stories and legacies
of its residents from 100 years ago.

## Mina Elizabeth Hall

[Mina Elizabeth Hall](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hall-1398), born on February
9, 1888, in Paulding County, Ohio, represents the deep-rooted connection of our
family to the region. Mina's life as a teacher and homemaker highlights the
everyday experiences of those living in Paulding County during that time. Her
presence in the county at the turn of the 20th century links our family history
to the broader narrative of Ohio's rural development and community life.

Mina is also an ancestor in the [Century Families of Ohio](/family/ogs/cfo).
