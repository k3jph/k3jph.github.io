As a captain in the [Maryland Defense Force
(MDDF)](https://military.maryland.gov/mddf/Pages/default.aspx), I
am proud to serve as a member of this highly trained and dedicated
agency. The MDDF is a volunteer military organization that serves
as a complement to the Maryland National Guard, providing critical
support to the state's emergency response efforts. With a focus on
disaster relief and other emergency services, the MDDF is a vital
part of Maryland's emergency response capabilities.

As a member of the MDDF, I have had the opportunity to work alongside
other highly skilled and motivated individuals from a wide range
of backgrounds. The MDDF is organized into several units, each with
its own unique mission and focus. These units include medical and
engineering, among others, each playing a critical role in supporting
Maryland's emergency response efforts.

I have had the opportunity to lead and manage teams of volunteers
in a variety of settings, from disaster response to training
exercises. I have gained invaluable experience in coordinating and
collaborating with other emergency response organizations and
agencies, including the Maryland National Guard and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Overall, my experience in the MDDF has been incredibly rewarding
and fulfilling. It has provided me with the opportunity to serve
my community and my state in a meaningful way, while also developing
important skills and knowledge that I can apply in both my personal
and professional life.

The following is a brief overview of my experience and
accomplishments with the MDDF.

### <a id='SMEMS' />Senior Military Emergency Management Specialist

Members of the U.S. uniformed services and state guards increasingly
have been mobilized to respond to natural and man-made disasters
and other emergencies. Military and civilian authorities now see
an urgent need to provide additional and improved emergency management
training for personnel deployed during disasters. The MEMS Academy
continues to fill that need.

Individuals with Basic MEMS certificates will have an operational understanding
of the principles of emergency management, including mitigation, preparedness,
emergency response and recovery with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed
to effectively work within a comprehensive emergency management operation. Those
with Senior and Master level certificates will be able to lead and plan incident
response efforts of increasing complexity.  The blue MEMS flash is awarded to
those who have been activated or mobilized for a disaster, declared emergency,
or major event requiring the activation of the  [Incident Command
System](https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/).

The MEMS badges are awarded by the [State Guard Association of the United
States](https://sgaus.org/) and are authorized for wear by MDDF members.

<!-- Members with the LNO certificate will be able to work within any EOC. -->

To call the training curriculum "Basic Training" is not fair, as
it only involved some light reading and passing a few written tests.

entire curriculum was revised into a more involved process called
"Initial Entry Training" (IET) and this ribbon was superseded with
one for the new IET process.
