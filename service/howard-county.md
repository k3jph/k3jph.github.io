## Board of Appeals

In 2011, I was appointed to the [Board of
Appeals](http://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals) for
Howard County.  The Board of Appeals has two roles in Howard County.
In the first role, cases for [conditional
uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-use_permit), sometimes
called special use permits, are heard by the Board of Appeals Hearing
Examiner.  Parties may appeal a decision of the Hearing Examiner
and the case will then be heard by the Board of Appeals.  When the
case is heard by the Board of Appeals, the testimony and evidence
are presented again, by all sides (there may be more than two), and
the Board of Appeals makes a decision.  A similar process is followed
for [variances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance).

In the second role, the Board of Appeals will hear cases as an
appellate body.  In these cases, a decision of some county agency
is brought to the Board of Appeals for review.  There are numerous
routes laid out in the [Howard County
Code](https://www.municode.com/library/md/howard_county) for an
appeal to be brought to the Board, and some are heard by the Hearing
Examiner before the Board.  In the last five years, the overwhelming
majority of these were land-use cases originating from a decision
of the Department of Planning and Zoning, such as code enforcement
decisions, and cases from the Howard County Planning Board, which
is authorized to approve development plans based on the Zoning
Regulations.  A handful of appeals cases came from the [Animal
Matters Hearing
Board](https://www.howardcountymd.gov/Departments/Police/Animal-Control/Animal-Matters-Hearing-Board).

For more information on the Board of Appeals, the [Howard County
Council maintains a microsite on the Board of Appeals and related
topics](http://cc.howardcountymd.gov/Zoning-Land-Use/Board-of-Appeals).

In January of 2016, the [County Council
reappointed](/2016/01/05/reappointed-to-the-board-of-appeals/) me
to the Board.

## Charter Review Commission

Every eight years, the [Howard County
Charter](https://library.municode.com/md/howard_county/codes/code_of_ordinances)
requires the County Council to appoint a Charter Review Commission
within three months of the new County Council's seating.  The Charter
Review Commission only has one technical responsibility and that
is to return its report no later than May 1st of the following year.
There are no requirements or guidelines for the report.  So the
Charter Review Commission takes its objective from its name and we
reviewed.

I was appointed to the 2019 Charter Review Commission along with
fourteen others from around the county.  We reviewed the Charter
section by section with the Office of Law, representatives from
different departments, and the Councilmembers themselves.  Howard
County has all of the agendas, minutes, and recordings of our
meetings available [on its
website](https://cc.howardcountymd.gov/About-Us/Commissions-Task-Forces-and-Special-Reports/Charter-Review-Commission-2019-2020).
We produced three major documents.

## Public Engagement in Land Use Planning Task Force

The Public Engagement in Land Use Planning Task Force (PELU) was a
short-term task force organized by the Howard County Council in
early 2008.  Members were designated into two groups, those
representing residents and those representing businesses.  The group
had two chairs, one from each group and I was the second co-chair
for the resident representatives.  The first co-chair was [Howard
Weinstein](https://jameshoward.us/2015/08/30/i-wonder-how-zoning-works-on-qonos/).
[Bill Erskine](http://www.offitkurman.com/attorney/william-e-erskine/)
was the co-chair representing businesses.

Bill set up a blog that we used to communicate.  It probably was
not the most effective way to do it, but it was easier than setting
up a wiki or some other things.  Members could use it very effectively,
by email if nothing else.  [It is still
posted](http://howardcountypelu.blogspot.com/), though obviously
has not been changed since 2008.
