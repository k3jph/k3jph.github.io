## Master Plan Committee

In 2009, the Howard County Government developed a set of steps each village must go through to complete a redevelopment of its village center.  One of these steps was developing a master plan for the redevelopment and in 2010 and 2011, this task in [Long Reach](http://longreach.org/) fell to a Master Plan Committee.  I sat committee with Columbia Council members Henry Dagenais, Ed Coleman, and Paul Bernard.  We produced a recommendation and the Village Board refined that recommendation into a master plan.  Both are linked to, below.
