As an educator, I strive to foster a deep love and appreciation for
the material that I teach. To achieve this, I believe in creating
an interactive and engaging learning environment that connects
students to the subject matter in a meaningful and relevant way.
My goal is to instill in students a sense of curiosity and intellectual
curiosity that extends beyond the classroom and into their everyday
lives.

One of my core teaching beliefs is that students learn best by
doing. I incorporate active learning strategies and real-world
applications into my courses to create an immersive and hands-on
learning experience. For example, in my financial management course,
my graduate students started a nonprofit from scratch. By putting
theory into practice, students gained a practical understanding of
the financial and accounting principles necessary to launch a
successful organization. Additionally, they developed important
leadership and community engagement skills that will serve them
well in their future careers.

I also believe in the importance of fostering a supportive and
inclusive learning environment. As an educator, I strive to create
a classroom culture that values diversity and encourages active
participation from all students. I seek to understand and respond
to the unique needs of each student to ensure that they feel heard,
respected, and valued.

In my classes, I use real-world examples and case studies to
illustrate how mathematical concepts and statistical methods can
be applied in practical situations. This approach helps students
to see the value of the material beyond the classroom and inspires
them to explore the subject matter further. I encourage students
to think critically, ask questions, and challenge assumptions to
develop a deep and nuanced understanding of the material.

Finally, I believe that education is a lifelong pursuit. As an
educator, I see myself as a lifelong learner, always seeking out
new knowledge and innovative teaching strategies to improve my
practice. I encourage my students to view learning as an ongoing
process and to continue to engage with the material long after they
have completed my course.

In summary, my teaching philosophy centers on creating an interactive
and inclusive learning environment that connects students to the
material in a meaningful and relevant way. By incorporating active
learning strategies, real-world applications, and a focus on diversity
and inclusion, I aim to inspire a lifelong love of learning in my
students and prepare them for success in their future careers.

## Mathematics

I have taught undergraduate mathematics at the [University of Maryland Global Campus](http://www.umuc.edu) since 2010, when it was called the University of Maryland University College. UMGC's classes are primarily delivered via distance education, though some courses are "hybrid" including a weekly session on campus, usually at the University of Maryland, College Park. At UMGC, I routinely teach the introductory mathematics courses:

*   **MATH 106 Finite Mathematics** A survey of basic business mathematics. This course includes an introduction to mathematical finance (loan and annuity modeling), simple matrix mathematics, linear programming, set theory, and basic probability.

Finally, I have taught courses from our statistics program. We are now down to just STAT 200, but we previously had an array of thematically-linked statistics classes for business, social science, and computer science:

*   **STAT 200 Introduction to Statistics** This is an introduction to applied statistics. Probability, t-tests, and [latex]\chi^2[/latex]-tests are introduced. Application areas are broadly selected from across many different fields.
    *   [Summer 2023 (OL1) Syllabus]()

*   **STAT 230 Introductory Business Statistics** This is is essentially the same as STAT 200, but the examples are drawn primarily from business settings and include production and finance problems. This class has since been discontinued in favor of STAT 200, above, as a generalized statistics course.

## Public Affairs and Management

### The University of New Mexico

### Central Michigan University

In the spring of 2017, I started occasionally teaching in the [Master of Science in Administration](https://www.cmich.edu/Global/Programs/Pages/degrees.aspx?dc=MSA) (MSA) program at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu/). It may seem like a long commute, but my courses are taught at Joint Base Andrews, here in Maryland, through the Central Michigan Global Campus initiative. The MSA program is a degree in management focusing on technical administration, drawing on the course content common in both master of public administration and master of business administration programs. I have taught four different courses for Central Michigan.

*   **MSA 600 Foundations of Research Methods in Administration** This course covers the basic research process starting with the scientific method, lit reviews, data collection, analysis, through to research writing. Through this course, a student is well-prepared to design and complete a research project in a government or business setting.
    *   [Spring 2017 Syllabus](/assets/docs/MSA600-Syllabus-Spring2017.pdf)
*   **MSA 607 Program Management in Complex Organizations** This course is a unique course that looks beyond standard project management and looks at the interrelationships of projects inside large and diversified organizations.

I taught for the following three semesters and taught courses over two years from the budgeting and fiscal administration track:

*   **PUAD 701 Public Administration and Public Finance** This course will consider the economic impacts of governmental policies, especially at the state and local level.
    *   [Fall 2015 Syllabus](/assets/docs/PUAD701-Syllabus-2015Rev.pdf)
    *   [Fall 2014 Syllabus](/assets/docs/PUAD701-Syllabus-2014.pdf)
*   **PUAD 702 Public Financial Management** A discussion of public financial management, including debt management, accounting policies, performance management, and accountability. This discussion should extend beyond the introductory graduate-level course on budgeting.
    *   [Spring 2015 Syllabus](/assets/docs/PUAD702-Syllabus-2015.pdf)
    *   [Spring 2014 Syllabus](/assets/docs/PUAD702-Syllabus-2014.pdf)
