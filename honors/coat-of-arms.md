At its core, heraldry started as a means of identification, evolving
over centuries from simple insignias to the complex art of designing,
displaying, and studying coats of arms. As we recognize it, the
tradition of heraldry emerged in the early 12th century, primarily
serving the practical purpose of distinguishing combatants who were
otherwise anonymized by their armor on the battlefield. This necessity
gave rise to the role of the herald, individuals who, clad in a
distinctive tabard, were tasked with conveying messages and issuing
challenges for their sovereigns or lords. They were shielded from
harm and armed with extensive knowledge of the armorial symbols
within their jurisdiction and beyond.

Over time, heralds gained the sovereign-backed authority to grant
coats of arms officially. Although the decline of armor in warfare
diminished heraldry's original functional role, it had already
cemented its place within the societal fabric, symbolizing status
and identity far beyond the battlefield. Coats of arms expanded in
scope and were awarded to the aristocracy and notable figures in
society seeking a distinctive form of identification amid widespread
illiteracy.

In the modern era, heraldry has transcended its practical origins
to become predominantly a symbol of prestige and heritage. While
some may attempt to adopt self-styled arms, proper legal recognition
of a coat of arms requires sanctioning by an authoritative body
acting under a mandate from the state. This ensures that heraldry
remains a respected tradition grounded in legitimacy and historical
continuity.

## Heraldry in Malta

The Republic of Malta boasts a rich tapestry of European heraldic
tradition, adorned with coats of arms that narrate the island's
history through its [noble
families](https://santfournier.org/MNINFO/maltesenobilityhistory.html), the
esteemed [Order of St. John](https://www.orderofmalta.int/), and
the ecclesiastical heritage. This heraldic legacy extends to various
institutions, including companies, schools, and corporations, each
bearing unique armorial symbols that contribute to the cultural
mosaic of the Maltese Islands.

{% include figure.html image="Coat-of-Arms-Chief-Herald-Malta.webp"
placement="right" width="40%" cap="Arms of the Office Of the Chief
Herald" alt="Arms of the Office Of the Chief Herald" %}

For a long time, the vibrant array of heraldic emblems across Malta
evolved without the oversight of a central regulatory body. This
changed with the recent establishment of the [Office of the Chief
Herald of Arms of Malta](https://maltaheraldry.mt/), located within
the historic confines of Fort St Elmo in Valletta. [Count Charles
Gauci](https://maltaheraldry.mt/about-us/)'s appointment as the
inaugural Chief Herald of Arms in 2019 marked the beginning of a
new era in Maltese heraldry.

Under the auspices of the Chief Herald of Arms, all newly granted
or registered coats of arms receive official recognition by the
State, ensuring their protection from unauthorized replication. The
Chief Herald's office regulates personal and corporate heraldic
symbols throughout Malta. This includes the creation and grant of
new arms, the registration of long-standing local arms, and the
acknowledgment of arms granted by recognized foreign authorities.

## My Grant of Arms

I received a grant of arms from the Office of the Chief Herald of
Arms of Malta, formalized through Letters Patent numbered G0102,
issued on May 1, 2024.  The formal notice of
this grant was published in the _Gazzetta tal-Gvern ta’ Malta_, the
official gazette of the Government of Malta, [in issue number
21,194, on Feburary 16, 2024](/assets/docs/malta-government-gazette-20240216.pdf). This publication
serves as the official record, ensuring transparency and public
acknowledgment of the newly granted arms.

This coat of arms, now officially recorded and recognized, joins a
storied collection of heraldic emblems that reflect the diverse
heritage and dynamic future of Malta. It stands as a symbol of honor
and distinction, offering a lasting legacy that will be cherished
by generations to come.

### Blazon

A blazon is the formal language of heraldry, an intricate system
of symbols and descriptions used for centuries to convey the
composition of coats of arms. It is a precise and codified language
that allows heralds and enthusiasts alike to recreate the visual
splendor of a heraldic shield from textual descriptions alone. Each
term in a blazon specifies colors, patterns, symbols, and placement,
ensuring that the coat of arms can be accurately interpreted and
replicated anywhere in the world.

<div class="row">
  <div class="item col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Argent in pale a tetrahedron Azure pierced in bend by a sword Or with pommel and cross piece of the Second.  Upon a helm befitting his degree with mantling Azure and doubled Or is set for crest, upon a wreath of the liveries a martlet Sable.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <div class="item col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Lewn il-Fidda in Pale tetrahedron lewn Ikħal minfud b’sejf In Bend lewn id-Deheb u bil-maqbad u s-salib tiegħu ta’ lewn Ikħal.Fuq elmu li jixraq il-grad tiegħu bid-drappeġġ Ikħal u lewn id-Deheb hemm bħala Kresta fuq girlanda tal-istess ilwien ħuttafa ta’ lewn Iswed.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

The blazon presented encapsulates a deeply personal and symbolic
heraldic identity, reflective of both heritage and individual
achievement. At its heart, the argent field sets a stage of purity
and sincerity, upon which a tetrahedron azure is prominently featured.
This geometric figure is not chosen randomly; it is a deliberate
nod to the world of mathematics, representing the bearer's role
within this discipline. The tetrahedron, a solid figure with four
triangular faces, is foundational in geometric studies and serves
as a metaphor for stability and intellectual building blocks,
mirroring the bearer's contributions to and foundations in mathematics.

Piercing the tetrahedron in bend is a sword, or; the seal of Cincinnati,
Ohio, directly inspires its design. This choice links the bearer's
heraldic identity to a significant locale. The imagery of the sword
also evokes the legendary tale of King Arthur's Excalibur, suggesting
themes of nobility, valor, and the destined right to leadership.
The "sword-in-the-stone" allusion enriches the emblem with a narrative
of overcoming challenges to achieve one's rightful place, much like
the mythical king.

cap="Kamon adapted from the Crest" alt="Kamon adapted from the Crest" %}
     
The crest features a martlet sable, a heraldic charge that holds rich
symbolism within the realm of heraldry. Suggested by Count Gauci, the
martlet's inclusion hints at a lineage likely connecting me to [Thomas
Arundell](https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/thomas-arundell), whose
arms bore six martlets. While the descent remains unproven, the martlet
is a significant symbol in heraldry, often representing continuous quest
and ambition.  Traditionally depicted without feet, the martlet is said
to be in perpetual flight, emblematic of constant endeavor and the
pursuit of higher aspirations. This imagery aligns with the bearer's
journey of discovery and excellence in their field. Therefore, the use
of the martlet is not only a potential nod to ancestral ties but also a
testament to the bearer's tireless dedication and pursuit of knowledge,
embodying the spirit of ambition and the relentless pursuit of
achievement.
            
In addition to incorporating the martlet into the crest of the coat of arms,
I've embraced a unique cross-cultural heraldic approach by creating an image of
the martlet styled as a Japanese _kamon_. 
A _kamon_ is a form of Japanese heraldry, symbolizing family crests or
emblems that date back to the Heian period (794-1185). Traditionally used to
identify family lineage, _kamon_ designs are elegantly simplistic and highly
stylized, often representing animals, plants, or abstract symbols. This
integration of a _kamon_ into the heraldic design not only highlights a blend of
Eastern and Western heraldic traditions but also reflects a personal connection
to the aesthetic and cultural significance of Japanese symbolism. 

### Motto

For a motto, I chose "_Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb_", which is
Maltese for "Only the will leads the heart." This motto underscores
the importance of determination and willpower in guiding one's
passions and decisions, suggesting that true leadership and direction
in life come from inner strength and resolve.

As an aside, Count Gauci suggested this was the first Maltese motto
he had seen in his term of office!

### Emblazonment

An emblazonment in heraldry refers to the artistic representation
of a coat of arms, bringing to life the abstract descriptions of a
blazon through vivid imagery and design. This process transforms
the precise and formulaic language of heraldry into a visual symbol
unique to the bearer, encapsulating their heritage, achievements,
and values. While there may be multiple emblazonments of the same
coat of arms, each with its own stylistic nuances and artistic
interpretations, they are all considered equivalent as long as they
accurately adhere to the details specified in the original blazon.
This principle allows for a rich diversity of heraldic art, where
the essence of the coat of arms remains consistent across different
renditions, showcasing the universal language of heraldry that
transcends individual variations in artistic expression.

I have developed two versions of my coat of arms, utilizing digital
techniques to craft the heraldic elements. Displayed side by side,
the version on the left adheres to the traditional English style,
while the one on the right follows the medieval convention. I have
used the medieval style in most cases due to its more compact and
streamlined design, which offers greater versatility for various
applications.

## Banner and Flag 

The coat of arms has also been adapted into flag and banner formats,
each serving distinct purposes and conforming to specific proportions.
This allows the heraldic design to be displayed in various contexts,
extending its visibility and versatility in use.

### Flag

The flag, presented in the standard 2:3 proportions, is designed for
broader, more public displays. Flags are typically used for flying from
flagpoles, serving as a symbol of identification and pride that can be
seen from a distance. The design of the flag ensures that it remains
recognizable and impactful even when viewed from afar. 

In my case, the flag version of my coat of arms retains the same content
as the original design, adapted to fit the rectangular format. This
adaptation ensures that the essential elements of the coat of arms are
maintained while providing a format that is suitable for outdoor use,
ceremonial occasions, and events where the emblem needs to be
prominently displayed to represent the bearer or the institution. The
flag is ideal for situations where visibility and ease of recognition
are paramount, such as during parades, official functions, or as a
marker of presence and authority.

### Banner

The banner, on the other hand, is presented in a square 1:1 proportion,
adhering to traditional heraldic practices. Banners are often used in
more formal and static displays, such as indoor environments,
processions, or when hung vertically from a balcony or a wall. The
square shape of the banner allows for a different visual emphasis, often
highlighting the central elements of the coat of arms with greater
prominence.

Banners serve as a heraldic standard, providing a more detailed and
elaborate representation of the arms. In contrast to flags, which are
meant to be viewed from a distance, banners are typically displayed
closer to the observer, allowing for a finer appreciation of the
intricate details and symbolism of the coat of arms. This makes banners
particularly suitable for ceremonial use, academic settings, or as part
of an exhibit where the heraldic art can be admired up close.

The banner version of my coat of arms focuses on the shield and crest,
ensuring that the primary symbols are prominently featured. This format
is ideal for formal occasions and environments where the banner can be
displayed as a testament to heritage and honor.

## Heraldic Badges

In addition to my coat of arms, I have adopted its design into heraldic
badges, reflecting both the English heraldic badge tradition and the
Scottish crest badge. Heraldic badges, distinct from coats of arms,
serve as a versatile symbol of allegiance and identification, often worn
by retainers and followers. These badges are simpler in design, intended
for widespread recognition and usage, extending the visual
representation of the bearer's heraldic identity beyond the formal
confines of a coat of arms.

Modern Maltese law of arms is influenced by both English and Scottish
heraldic traditions, reflecting the island's historical ties and
cultural exchanges with the British Isles. This influence is evident in
the adoption of heraldic practices and symbols that honor the rich
tapestry of Maltese history while incorporating elements from these
well-established heraldic systems. By integrating these traditions, the
Maltese heraldic system ensures a robust framework for granting and
regulating coats of arms and badges, maintaining a respectful nod to its
diverse heraldic heritage.

### English Heraldic Badges

The English heraldic badge I have adopted features two distinct designs,
each reflecting different aspects of my armigerous status and personal
values.  The primary badge incorporates the martlet from my crest,
depicted in front of the sword from my coat of arms, which is arranged
vertically.  This design choice adds a layer of complexity and meaning,
combining two significant elements from my coat of arms into a single,
cohesive emblem. The badge is designed to be recognizable and
straightforward, making it suitable for various applications such as
seals, stationery, and personal regalia.

The martlet, depicted in a prominent and uncluttered manner, maintains
its symbolic significance of continuous quest and ambition.
Traditionally, the martlet is seen as a symbol of perpetual effort and
aspiration, as it is often shown without feet, suggesting a bird that
never comes to rest. This aligns with the values of constant endeavor
and the pursuit of higher goals. Including the sword complements the
martlet's representation of tireless endeavor. The sword's vertical
arrangement evokes strength and readiness, highlighting themes of
nobility and righteousness. Together, these elements create a badge that
serves as a personal emblem, reflecting the enduring effort towards
personal and professional goals, and the commitment to uphold principles
of justice and honor.

The second design, an English-style crest badge, features the martlet
atop a torse. This simpler arrangement reflects the traditional display
of a crest in English heraldry, emphasizing the martlet's central role
as a personal emblem. The torse, the twisted band of fabric that
supports the crest, signifies the connection to the armorial bearings
and provides a foundation for the martlet. This version of the badge
highlights elegance and tradition, offering a versatile option for use
in less formal settings while still maintaining its heraldic
significance.

Both versions of the English heraldic badge offer flexibility in their
application, allowing for use across different contexts while preserving
the integrity of the heraldic symbolism. Together, they provide a
unified yet diverse representation of my heraldic identity.

### Scottish Crest Badge

The Scottish crest badge, traditionally worn as a cap badge,
incorporates elements from my crest within a belt and buckle design,
symbolizing loyalty and fidelity. This format is deeply rooted in
Scottish heraldic tradition, where the belt and buckle, or strap and
buckle, signifies allegiance to a clan chief and adherence to a shared
heritage.

The central element of my Scottish crest badge is the martlet, which is
encircled by a belt bearing the motto "_Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb_."
The martlet, a small bird depicted without feet, traditionally
symbolizes continuous quest and ambition, representing the idea of
perpetual journey and striving for excellence. This imagery aligns with
my personal values of constant endeavor and the pursuit of higher
aspirations.

Additionally, my crest badge incorporates a feather, which is a
significant symbol within Scottish heraldry and marks the badge bearer
as an armiger—one entitled to bear arms. Traditionally, feathers on an
armiger's badge are used to differentiate the wearer from other members
of the clan who may also display the chief's crest badge. This
distinction underscores the individual's recognized status and personal
achievements in heraldry. The feather in my badge further complements
the martlet’s symbolism of upward ambition, evoking ideas of
intellectual elevation and grace.

The belt and buckle design is a prominent feature in Scottish crest
badges, symbolizing a strong and binding connection to one's lineage and
loyalty to the clan or family represented by the crest. The circular
form of the belt signifies unity and continuity, while the buckle
denotes security and steadfastness. This design element emphasizes a
sense of belonging and commitment, reinforcing the collective identity
of the bearers of the badge.

In my crest badge, the belt and buckle also serve to frame the martlet,
feather, and motto, highlighting their importance and ensuring that the
emblem is cohesive and visually balanced. The integration of the belt
and buckle with my personal motto further underscores the themes of
determination and leadership, suggesting that true guidance and
direction in life come from inner strength and resolve.

## Additional Emblazonments

In this section, we showcase various artistic interpretations of my coat of
arms, highlighting the diversity and creativity within heraldic art. Each
emblazonment, while adhering to the same blazon, brings a unique style and
perspective, reflecting the individual artistry of the creators. These
variations enrich the visual representation of the arms, demonstrating how
heraldry can be both a precise science and a vibrant art form.  By exploring
different emblazonments, we can appreciate the multifaceted nature of heraldic
design and its capacity to convey identity and heritage through various artistic
lenses.
