The [Royal House of Keōua Nui](https://www.crownofhawaii.com/),
integral to the rich tapestry of Hawaiian history, traces its lineage
back to the early 19th century, starting with King Kamehameha I,
who united the Hawaiian Islands into a single kingdom in 1810. This
unification under the Kamehameha dynasty laid the groundwork for
developing a modern Hawaiian state, blending traditional governance
with influences brought by global interactions.

The Royal House, as established by Keōua Nui, father of [Kamehameha
I](https://www.gohawaii.com/culture/history/king-kamehameha), has
been a symbol of continuity amidst the shifting tides of political,
social, and economic changes over the centuries. The monarchy played
a pivotal role in navigating foreign influences and internal reforms.
Notably, King Kalākaua, known for his visionary leadership, was
instrumental in promoting a resurgence of Hawaiian culture and
national pride during his reign in the late 19th century. He founded
the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania in 1886 to foster alliances
across the Pacific, demonstrating a proactive approach to international
relations and cultural exchange.

However, the [overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani in
1893](https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/queen-liliuokalani-overthrown/)
marked a significant turning point, leading to the eventual annexation
of Hawai'i by the United States in 1898. Despite these challenges,
the descendants of the Hawaiian monarchy have continued to uphold
their cultural heritage and advocate for the rights and recognition
of Native Hawaiians.

In modern times, the Royal House of Keōua Nui, led by [H.R.H.
Princess Owana Kaʻōhelelani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owana_Salazar),
plays a ceremonial and cultural role. It strives to preserve the
legacies of its royal lineage, promoting education about Hawaiian
history, language, and traditions. The re-establishment of traditional
honors, such as the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania, underlines
ongoing efforts to celebrate and perpetuate the significance of
Hawai'i's royal heritage in both local and international contexts.

## The Royal Order of the Star of Oceania 

The [Royal Order of the Star of
Oceania](https://uchterhous.org/knights-2/elementor-1149/hawaii/),
established by [King
Kalākaua](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/08/10/david-kalakaua) in
1886, was conceived as a mechanism to unite and build alliances
across the Pacific. Its founding was part of King Kalākauai's [visionary
plan](https://imagesofoldhawaii.com/polynesian-confederacy/)
to create a [confederation of Polynesian nations and Pacific
islands](https://worldhistoryconnected.press.uillinois.edu/8.3/forum_cook.html),
aiming to strengthen regional ties and promote mutual interests
against colonial expansion. The Order symbolized the King’s
forward-thinking approach to international diplomacy and his
commitment to advocating for the sovereignty and collaboration of
island nations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

However, the order was abolished following the overthrow of Queen
Lili'uokalani in 1893, an event that marked the decline of the
Hawaiian monarchy and the eventual annexation of the Hawaiian Islands
by the United States. The Order lay dormant until its revival in
2020 by the senior heir to the House of Keoua Nui, H.R.H. Princess
Owana Ka'ōhelelani. This revival was part of a broader effort to
restore and honor the Hawaiian people's cultural heritage and
historical sovereignty.

Today, the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania is not only linked
to the Hawaiian monarchy's past ambitions but also as a contemporary
emblem of cultural recognition and educational excellence.  In its
modern form, the Order also functions as a platform for promoting
educational initiatives and cultural preservation among the Hawaiian
and Polynesian communities. It highlights the importance of maintaining
and celebrating the unique cultural identities of the Pacific islands
while advocating for cooperation and mutual respect among diverse
cultures. The Royal Order of the Star of Oceania thus continues to
embody the spirit of unity and recognition that was its original
intent, bridging historical traditions with contemporary pursuits
in cultural diplomacy and education.
