At its core, heraldry started as a means of identification, evolving
over centuries from simple insignias to the complex art of designing,
displaying, and studying coats of arms. As we recognize it, the
tradition of heraldry emerged in the early 12th century, primarily
serving the practical purpose of distinguishing combatants who were
otherwise anonymized by their armor on the battlefield. This necessity
gave rise to the role of the herald, individuals who, clad in a
distinctive tabard, were tasked with conveying messages and issuing
challenges for their sovereigns or lords. They were shielded from
harm and armed with extensive knowledge of the armorial symbols
within their jurisdiction and beyond.

Over time, heralds gained the sovereign-backed authority to grant
coats of arms officially. Although the decline of armor in warfare
diminished heraldry's original functional role, it had already
cemented its place within the societal fabric, symbolizing status
and identity far beyond the battlefield. Coats of arms expanded in
scope and were awarded to the aristocracy and notable figures in
society seeking a distinctive form of identification amid widespread
illiteracy.

In the modern era, heraldry has transcended its practical origins
to become predominantly a symbol of prestige and heritage. While
some may attempt to adopt self-styled arms, proper legal recognition
of a coat of arms requires sanctioning by an authoritative body
acting under a mandate from the state. This ensures that heraldry
remains a respected tradition grounded in legitimacy and historical
continuity.

## Heraldry in Malta

The Republic of Malta boasts a rich tapestry of European heraldic
tradition, adorned with coats of arms that narrate the island's
history through its [noble
families](https://santfournier.org/MNINFO/maltesenobilityhistory.html), the
esteemed [Order of St. John](https://www.orderofmalta.int/), and
the ecclesiastical heritage. This heraldic legacy extends to various
institutions, including companies, schools, and corporations, each
bearing unique armorial symbols that contribute to the cultural
mosaic of the Maltese Islands.

Herald" alt="Arms of the Office Of the Chief Herald" %}

For a long time, the vibrant array of heraldic emblems across Malta
evolved without the oversight of a central regulatory body. This
changed with the recent establishment of the [Office of the Chief
Herald of Arms of Malta](https://maltaheraldry.mt/), located within
the historic confines of Fort St Elmo in Valletta. [Count Charles
Gauci](https://maltaheraldry.mt/about-us/)'s appointment as the
inaugural Chief Herald of Arms in 2019 marked the beginning of a
new era in Maltese heraldry.

Under the auspices of the Chief Herald of Arms, all newly granted
or registered coats of arms receive official recognition by the
State, ensuring their protection from unauthorized replication. The
Chief Herald's office regulates personal and corporate heraldic
symbols throughout Malta. This includes the creation and grant of
new arms, the registration of long-standing local arms, and the
acknowledgment of arms granted by recognized foreign authorities.

## My Grant of Arms

I received a grant of arms from the Office of the Chief Herald of
Arms of Malta, formalized through Letters Patent numbered G0102,
issued on an unspecified day in March 2024.  The formal notice of
this grant was published in the _Gazzetta tal-Gvern taâ€™ Malta_, the
official gazette of the Government of Malta, [in issue number
21,194, on Feburary 16, 2024](/assets/docs/malta-government-gazette-20240216.pdf). This publication
serves as the official record, ensuring transparency and public
acknowledgment of the newly granted arms.

This coat of arms, now officially recorded and recognized, joins a
storied collection of heraldic emblems that reflect the diverse
heritage and dynamic future of Malta. It stands as a symbol of honor
and distinction, offering a lasting legacy that will be cherished
by generations to come.

### Blazon

A blazon is the formal language of heraldry, an intricate system
of symbols and descriptions used for centuries to convey the
composition of coats of arms. It is a precise and codified language
that allows heralds and enthusiasts alike to recreate the visual
splendor of a heraldic shield from textual descriptions alone. Each
term in a blazon specifies colors, patterns, symbols, and placement,
ensuring that the coat of arms can be accurately interpreted and
replicated anywhere in the world.

a sword Or with pommel and cross piece of the Second.

doubled Or is set for crest, upon a wreath of the liveries a
martlet Sable

The blazon presented encapsulates a deeply personal and symbolic
heraldic identity, reflective of both heritage and individual
achievement. At its heart, the argent field sets a stage of purity
and sincerity, upon which a tetrahedron azure is prominently featured.
This geometric figure is not chosen randomly; it is a deliberate
nod to the world of mathematics, representing the bearer's role
within this discipline. The tetrahedron, a solid figure with four
triangular faces, is foundational in geometric studies and serves
as a metaphor for stability and intellectual building blocks,
mirroring the bearer's contributions to and foundations in mathematics.

Piercing the tetrahedron in bend is a sword, or; the seal of Cincinnati,
Ohio, directly inspires its design. This choice links the bearer's
heraldic identity to a significant locale. The imagery of the sword
also evokes the legendary tale of King Arthur's Excalibur, suggesting
themes of nobility, valor, and the destined right to leadership.
The "sword-in-the-stone" allusion enriches the emblem with a narrative
of overcoming challenges to achieve one's rightful place, much like
the mythical king.

The crest features a martlet sable, a heraldic charge that holds
rich symbolism within the realm of heraldry. Suggested by Count
Gauci, the martlet's inclusion hints at a lineage likely connecting
me to Thomas Arundell, whose arms bore six martlets. While the
descent remains unproven, the martlet is a significant symbol in
heraldry, often representing continuous quest and ambition.
Traditionally depicted without feet, the martlet is said to be in
perpetual flight, emblematic of constant endeavor and the pursuit
of higher aspirations. This imagery aligns with the bearer's journey
of discovery and excellence in their field. Therefore, the use of
the martlet is not only a potential nod to ancestral ties but also
a testament to the bearer's tireless dedication and pursuit of
knowledge, embodying the spirit of ambition and the relentless
pursuit of achievement.
            
In addition to incorporating the martlet into the crest of the coat of arms,
I've embraced a unique cross-cultural heraldic approach by creating an image of
the martlet styled as a Japanese _kamon_. 
A _kamon_ is a form of Japanese heraldry, symbolizing family crests or
emblems that date back to the Heian period (794-1185). Traditionally used to
identify family lineage, _kamon_ designs are elegantly simplistic and highly
stylized, often representing animals, plants, or abstract symbols. This
integration of a _kamon_ into the heraldic design not only highlights a blend of
Eastern and Western heraldic traditions but also reflects a personal connection
to the aesthetic and cultural significance of Japanese symbolism. 

### Motto

For a motto, I chose "_Ir-rieda biss tmexxi l-qalb_", which is
Maltese for "Only the will leads the heart." This motto underscores
the importance of determination and willpower in guiding one's
passions and decisions, suggesting that true leadership and direction
in life come from inner strength and resolve.

As an aside, Count Gauci suggested this was the first Maltese motto
he had seen in his term of office!

### Emblazonment

An emblazonment in heraldry refers to the artistic representation
of a coat of arms, bringing to life the abstract descriptions of a
blazon through vivid imagery and design. This process transforms
the precise and formulaic language of heraldry into a visual symbol
unique to the bearer, encapsulating their heritage, achievements,
and values. While there may be multiple emblazonments of the same
coat of arms, each with its own stylistic nuances and artistic
interpretations, they are all considered equivalent as long as they
accurately adhere to the details specified in the original blazon.
This principle allows for a rich diversity of heraldic art, where
the essence of the coat of arms remains consistent across different
renditions, showcasing the universal language of heraldry that
transcends individual variations in artistic expression.

I have developed two versions of my coat of arms, utilizing digital
techniques to craft the heraldic elements. Displayed side by side,
the version on the left adheres to the traditional English style,
while the one on the right follows the medieval convention. I have
used the medieval style in most cases due to its more compact and
streamlined design, which offers greater versatility for various
applications.

The coat of arms has also been adapted into flag and banner formats,
presented in the standard 2:3 flag proportions and the square 1:1
banner proportions. This allows for the heraldic design to be
displayed in various contexts, extending its visibility and versatility
in use.
