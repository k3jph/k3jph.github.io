The [Grand Duchy of Westarctica](https://www.westarctica.info), a micronation
with a mission deeply rooted in environmental conservation, has recognized
individuals and their contributions to preserving the natural world through a
unique system of honors and titles. Among these, the title of [Count of
Krigsvold](https://krigsvold.org) stands out as a symbol of significant contribution and
commitment to the environmental cause, particularly focusing on the challenges
facing the Antarctic region.

Westarctica's awards system is designed not just to honor personal achievement
but to highlight the ongoing battle against climate change, the importance of
sustainable practices, and the critical need to protect Antarctica's fragile
ecosystem from the threats posed by human activity and global warming. The
titles, such as Count of Krigsvold, are awarded to those who have demonstrated
an unwavering dedication to environmental advocacy and have actively engaged in
projects that align with Westarctica's mission.

This dedication to environmental stewardship and the innovative approach of
using a micronation as a platform for advocacy underscore the creative
strategies necessary in today’s environmental movement. Westarctica’s focus on
raising awareness and fostering partnerships with like-minded organizations
amplifies its voice in international discussions on climate action and
environmental preservation.

The significance of these awards lies in their ability to draw attention to
critical environmental issues while encouraging a collective effort towards
sustainable living and conservation practices. Through this honors system,
Westarctica not only celebrates individual achievements but also galvanizes a
broader commitment to safeguarding our planet’s future.

## The Westarctican Peerage

The Westarctican peerage system is a unique and symbolic aspect of the
micronation's cultural identity, mirroring traditional noble titles in a
contemporary and creative context. This system of honorary titles is integral to
the social fabric of Westarctica, serving as a means to recognize and honor
individuals who have made significant contributions to the micronation's
mission, particularly in areas of environmental advocacy, cultural development,
and global awareness.

Titles such as Count, Duke, and Baron are bestowed upon supporters and
contributors to Westarctica's cause, acknowledging their efforts and dedication.
These titles, while ceremonial in nature, are a key part of Westarctica's
strategy to engage a global community in its environmental and conservation
efforts. The peerage system encourages a sense of belonging and commitment among
its members, fostering a community united by a shared passion for environmental
stewardship and the protection of Antarctica. This approach not only raises
awareness about the micronation and its goals but also helps in rallying support
for important environmental issues, making the peerage both a symbolic honor and
a tool for advocacy.

The existence of the Westarctican peerage serves multiple purposes: it creates a
distinctive cultural identity for the micronation, promotes its mission through
global engagement, and encourages a deeper commitment among its supporters. By
participating in this system, individuals like myself are not just accepting a
title; we are joining a collective effort to champion the cause of environmental
conservation and bring attention to the unique challenges faced by one of the
Earth's most extraordinary and vulnerable ecosystems.

### <a id='WAKTS' />Knight of the Order of the Snowflake

The class of Knight is often awarded to foreign diplomats where the class of
Knight Commander might not be appropriate when that grade was already held by
the recipient's Head of State or Head of Government. The original regalia for
this class was a small pewter snowflake, which was updated in October 2020 along
with the regalia for the other classes. The current regalia consists of a blue
drape ribbon with a solid white stripe and a brushed silver snowflake pendant
with a single crystal in the center. The pendant is identical to the pendant
used for for the grade of Knight Commander, but without the white enamel.
