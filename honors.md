Welcome to the section of my website dedicated to the honors and
recognitions that have been generously awarded over the years. This
space is not just a reflection of personal milestones but, more
importantly, a testament to the collaborative efforts and shared
aspirations of the many individuals and communities I've had the
privilege to work alongside.

The journey through academia and public service is marked by
collective endeavors—whether it's contributing to the intricate
world of public finance, engaging in the critical analysis of policy
and its impact on society, or fostering environments that encourage
educational and technological advancement. Each recognition received
is a reminder of our shared commitment to service, scholarship, and
the pursuit of knowledge for the greater good.

The awards and honors featured here represent milestones in a
continuous journey of learning, teaching, and engaging with the
world around us. They underscore the importance of community
involvement, the pursuit of evidence-based solutions to complex
challenges, and the essential role of open dialogue and exchange
across various fields and disciplines.

I invite you to explore this section not just as a showcase of
individual achievement, but as a celebration of the collective
spirit and dedication that drive progress and innovation. It is a
tribute to the mentors, colleagues, students, and community members
who inspire and propel us forward, reminding us that the most
meaningful accomplishments are those we achieve together.

## Coat of Arms from Malta

The [coat of arms](/honors/malta) I've been honored with by Malta
represents a fusion of personal heritage and professional dedication,
encapsulated within the ancient tradition of heraldry. At its heart,
the design features a tetrahedron and a sword, symbols of my
mathematical pursuits and connections to Cincinnati, Ohio, respectively.
This emblem not only reflects my academic and public service
contributions but also hints at a storied lineage, potentially
linked to Thomas Arundell through the inclusion of a martlet, a nod
to the unproven but cherished ancestral ties. This heraldic achievement
celebrates a commitment to community, knowledge, and the enduring
quest for understanding.

## Royal Order of the Star of Oceania

I was honored as a [Knight Commander of the Royal Order of the Star
of Oceania](/honors/hawaii) by H.R.H Princess Owana Ka'ōhelelani
on March 17th, 2024. This distinction not only celebrates my efforts
in promoting Polynesian culture and education. This venerable
accolade, reinstated to foster cultural ties and mutual respect
among Pacific nations, acknowledges my dedication to preserving and
enlightening a rich heritage spanning the vast expanse of Oceania.
As a Knight Commander, I am committed to embodying the principles
of this Order, advocating for cultural preservation, and enhancing
educational opportunities across the Pacific.

## Kentucky Colonel

I was appointed a [Kentucky Colonel by Governor Andy Beshear on
March 25th, 2024](/2024/04/02/i-was-appointed-a-kentucky-colonel),
an accolade that not only recognizes my contributions to the community
but also continues a valued family tradition, following in the
footsteps of my father. This prestigious title, the highest honor
granted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a testament to a steadfast
commitment to the values of leadership, excellence, and service.
As a Kentucky Colonel, I am dedicated to advancing these ideals and
positively impacting our communities and beyond.

## Grand Duchy of Westarctica

My recognition by [Westarctica](/honors/westarctica), through
prestigious awards, underscores a commitment to environmental
advocacy and public service on a global scale. These honors, including
titles and commendations, are reflective of efforts to address
critical environmental issues, bolstering awareness and action
within the international community. Westarctica's recognition not
only highlights individual contributions to conservation and
sustainability but also reinforces the importance of global
stewardship. Each award from Westarctica is a reminder of the
collective responsibility we share in preserving our planet for
future generations.
