* Proposal Submission Deadline: March 31, 2023

## Introduction

In 2017, the first call for proposals for _Teaching and Learning
Mathematics Online_ (_TLMO_) opened with these words:

> Online education has grown to be a major component of the higher
education market in both the United States and worldwide.

We had no idea what was to come.  In 2020, as the first edition
came out, COVID-19 simultaneously changed everything, especially
education.  Courses had to go online with nearly no notice and
teachers used to the classroom, at every level, were suddenly talking
to a computer screen.

Today, after three years, it is time to evaluate the lessons learned
from this experience.  We would like to know what worked and what
did not.  And we would like to know what can be done better.
Accordingly, this is the call for proposals for the second edition
of _TLMO_.

## Objectives of the Book

The objective of _TLMO_ is to provide a set of practice standards for
educators teaching mathematics and statistics in the online and
hybrid environments. The text will present sound methods for
delivering mathematical content to students grounded in both the
research and practice of mathematics education. It will also present
methods and tools for integrating online material to students in
the traditional classroom.

We will welcome chapters that focus on empirical research, theoretical
frameworks, or detailed case studies showing what works in the
classroom. We are also interested chapters that provide content for
international education, especially to students in the developing
world.  That said, we are most interested in chapters that give us
lessons learned from the COVID-19 experience and chapters that focus
on academic integrity in this setting.  As a whole, _TLMO_ should
provide a framework for developing, implementing, and teaching
online mathematics and statistics courses to students across
disciplines and skill levels.

## Target Audience

The target audience for _TLMO_ are practicing educators, at the
high school, collegiate, and postgraduate level. These educators
are familiar with mathematics and statistical instruction, but may
be new to the online or hybrid classroom. These educations may also
be interested in integrating online instruction in the traditional
classroom. In addition to practicing educators, _TLMO_ will also
appeal to mathematics education researchers and instructors of other
natural sciences who must integrate mathematical and statistical
content into online and hybrid courses. The volume will be a handbook
of methods and practices for teaching excellence across mathematical
courses.

## Submission Procedure

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit their chapter
proposals. All submitted chapters will be reviewed on a double-blind
review basis. Contributors may also be requested to serve as reviewers
for this project. This publication is anticipated to be released
in 2024.

Proposals should be [submitted via a
webform](https://forms.gle/vtcXAw14pS8qMsbJ8).  Inquiries are welcome
and should be submitted to James P. Howard, II
<[james.howard@jhu.edu](mailto:james.howard@jhu.edu)>.

Note: There are no submission or acceptance fees for manuscripts
submitted to this book publication. All manuscripts are accepted
based on a double-blind peer-review editorial process.
