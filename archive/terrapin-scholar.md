In September 2005, the University of Maryland, College Park, announced
the launch of a public art initiative called the Fear the Turtle
Sculpture Project. I participated in this competition with a design
intended to honor the College Park Scholars. My concept featured the
Scholar's sun spot logo prominently on the turtle’s plastron and the
University’s globe seal on its carapace. On November 30, 2005, I
received the exciting news that my design had been selected, and a
sponsor had been found.

The completed turtle sculpture stands at an impressive four and a half
feet tall and three and a half feet wide. Crafted from hollow cast
resin, it weighs approximately 100 pounds. The painting process involved
primarily common indoor/outdoor enamel spray paint, with the toes,
tongue, and eyes meticulously hand-painted. To ensure its durability,
the entire sculpture received several coats of spray-on enamel clear
coating, a process that took about three months to complete.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Waldo and Jean Burnside for
their generous sponsorship of my sculpture, which has contributed to
scholarships for the University and celebrated the achievements of
Scholars. Additionally, a big thank you to Nina Basu, Joseph Howard,
Amit Arwindekar, and Aggie Dog for their invaluable assistance in
painting, sanding, and taping the giant turtle.

## Exhibition

The Terrapin Scholar was proudly displayed at the Cambridge Community
Center at the University of Maryland, College Park, during the summer of
2006.

## Completion

The Terrapin Scholar was returned to College Park on March 24, 2006.
Below are pictures of the finalized sculpture.

## Body Complete

The process of completing the turtle’s body involved taping the
quadrants, a task that Joe assisted with. He took on the bulk of the
spray painting, ensuring that every detail was carefully applied.
Interestingly, the turtle turned out to be nearly as tall as Nina!

## Preparations

To prepare the turtle model for painting, we began by sanding down some
rough spots to create a smooth surface. We also addressed a few
scratches that had occurred during transportation. In the midst of this
process, Nina was busy capturing the moments with her camera.

## Ready for the Holidays

What else could we possibly have him wear but a festive Santa hat? It
perfectly complements his cheerful demeanor and adds a whimsical touch
to the sculpture, making him a true holiday mascot!
