The [Fairbanks Family in America](https://fairbankshouse.org/membership/) (FFA)
is a family association dedicated to the descendants of Jonathan Fairbanks, an
early New England colonist whose family legacy is inseparably linked with one of
the most important surviving structures of the seventeenth century. Founded in
1957, the society promotes historical scholarship, preservation, and public
education relating to the Fairbanks family and early colonial Massachusetts.

Membership in the society is open to individuals who can document direct lineal
descent from Jonathan Fairbanks, who settled in Dedham, Massachusetts, in the
early years of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The organization places particular
emphasis on the preservation and interpretation of the Fairbanks House, a rare
and exceptionally well-documented example of early colonial domestic
architecture.

## Jonathan Fairbanks

Jonathan Fairbanks was born in England around 1594 and immigrated to New England
during the Great Migration, arriving in Massachusetts by 1633. He was among the
early settlers of Dedham, a community established to the southwest of Boston as
colonial settlement expanded inland from the coast.

Fairbanks became a landholder, farmer, and community member in Dedham at a time
when the colony was still consolidating its social, legal, and religious
institutions. Surviving town and land records place him firmly within the first
generation of stable English settlement in the region. His life reflects the
experience of many early Puritan colonists, combining agricultural labor with
civic participation and religious observance.

Jonathan Fairbanks married Grace Smith, and together they raised a large family
whose descendants spread throughout New England and, in later generations,
across the expanding American frontier. Through these lines, the Fairbanks
family became widely represented in colonial and early national America.

## Fairbanks House

The [Fairbanks House](https://fairbankshouse.org), constructed beginning around
1637, stands as the oldest surviving timber-frame house in North America. Built
by Jonathan Fairbanks and expanded by successive generations, the house provides
an extraordinary architectural record spanning more than three centuries of
continuous family occupancy.

Unlike many early colonial dwellings that were lost to fire, redevelopment, or
neglect, the Fairbanks House remained in the possession of Fairbanks descendants
until the early twentieth century. This uninterrupted stewardship preserved not
only the structure itself but also a layered record of domestic life,
construction techniques, and adaptation over time. Architectural analysis of the
house reveals early English framing methods, original seventeenth-century
timbers, and later additions that reflect changing needs and styles across
generations.

Today, the house operates as a museum and educational site, offering visitors a
tangible connection to the lived experience of early New England settlers. Its
preservation is central to the mission of the Fairbanks Family in America and
serves as a focal point for public interpretation of colonial history.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

The Fairbanks family occupies a distinctive place in American colonial history
precisely because their story can be traced not only through documents but
through a standing structure that survives substantially intact. The Fairbanks
House allows historians, architects, and the public to examine early colonial
domestic life in a way that few other sites permit.

For descendants, the house functions as more than an ancestral landmark. It is a
material link to the conditions, skills, and choices that shaped early English
settlement in New England. The continuity of occupation and adaptation embodied
in the house underscores the long arc of family life in colonial and
post-colonial America, moving from frontier subsistence to established community
and, eventually, historical memory.
