The [Society of the Descendants of Washington's Army at Valley
Forge](https://www.valleyforgesociety.com/) (DVF) is a lineage society dedicated
to preserving the memory of those who served in the Continental Army during the
harsh winter encampment at Valley Forge from December 19, 1777, to June
19, 1778. Membership is open to any individual who can prove lineal descent from
a soldier who served under General George Washington at Valley Forge during this
defining moment of the American Revolution.

## William Darby: Revolutionary War Drummer and Pioneer

[William Darby](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Darby-352), born circa 1760,
served as a drummer in the [Continental
Army](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/continental-army)
during the [American Revolutionary
War](https://services.dar.org/Public/DAR_Research/search_adb/?action=full&p_id=A029776).
He was a member of Captain Laurence Keene's company and is listed in the Valley
Forge Muster Roll, confirming his presence during the brutal winter encampment
of 1777-1778. Darby's role as a drummer was not ornamental, he was part of the
Army's essential communications system.

During his extended service from 1777 to 1783, Darby reportedly participated in
key battles, including Germantown, Princeton, Monmouth, and Brandywine. He also
appears in the records as a drummer in Captain Davis's company. The position of
drummer was both dangerous and indispensable, often placing boys and young men
like Darby near the front lines to transmit crucial signals by sound. His
endurance through the war's many trials speaks to his resilience and commitment
to the revolutionary cause.

### The Role of Drummers in the Continental Army

In the 18th century, before the age of portable radios or electronic
communication, armies relied on a [structured system of drumbeats and signals to
coordinate movement, enforce discipline, and communicate
commands](https://fifeanddrum.army.mil/kids_fife_drum.html) across the noise and
confusion of battle. Drummers were trained to execute a wide vocabulary of
beats, each with specific meaning: calls to arms, assembly, retreat, advance,
firing drills, and even wake-up and lights-out routines.

In camp, drummers regulated the soldiers' daily schedule. On the battlefield,
they were indispensable. Officers would issue an order, and the drummer would
render it instantly audible to the entire unit. In this way, a single drummer's
rhythm could shift the direction of a regiment or trigger coordinated action
across the field. Drummers also helped maintain morale, their steady cadence
offering psychological structure in moments of chaos.

Because of their central function, drummers were often targeted by the enemy,
both to disrupt communication and demoralize troops. Yet despite this, many were
young, sometimes as young as twelve, and many, like William Darby, demonstrated
remarkable bravery under fire.

### Post-War Life and Legacy

After the war, William Darby married [Signet
Rushton](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rushton-167) in Randolph County, North
Carolina. Around 1805, he migrated to Ohio, eventually settling in what is now
Vinton County. He remarried in 1809, this time to Hannah Andrew, and became a
landowner, receiving 80 acres in Jackson County in 1826 as part of federal land
grants to veterans.  William Darby died on April 30, 1836. Though originally
buried near Allensville, Ohio, his remains were later honored with a granite
monument erected in Bell Cemetery by his descendants in 1915.
