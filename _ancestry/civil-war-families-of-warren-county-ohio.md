## Thomas Wesley Newman

[Thomas Wesley Newman](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Newman-16570)
(1838–1922) was a Civil War soldier from Warren County, Ohio. He served
in Company H, 79th Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, enlisting on
August 14, 1862, and was medically discharged on November 5, 1862.

### Early Life and Family

Thomas was born in Warren County, Ohio, in 1838, the son of [Joseph
Newman and Rebecca Pugh](/ancestry/eswco). The Newman family had
long-standing ties to the region. His father, Joseph, was a farmer in
Waynesville, Warren County.

### Civil War Service

Thomas enlisted in the 79th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Company H, on
August 14, 1862. The regiment was organized at Camp Dennison, Ohio, and
shortly after its formation, it was ordered to Kentucky on September
3, 1862. By September 7, the regiment advanced to Crittenden, Kentucky,
and later moved to Louisville.

In early October 1862, the 79th Ohio marched to Frankfort, Kentucky,
[occupying the city on October
9](http://www.ohiocivilwar.com/cw79.html).  They remained stationed
there until October 26, during which time they conducted an expedition
to Lawrenceburg in pursuit of Confederate forces under General John Hunt
Morgan from October 10–13. Following this, the regiment marched to
Bowling Green, Kentucky, from October 26 to November 4, then proceeded
to Scottsville, eventually reaching Gallatin, Tennessee, on November
25, 1862. The 79th Ohio remained on duty in Gallatin until December 11,
1862.

During this period, the regiment was attached to [Ward's Brigade, 12th
Division, Army of the
Ohio](https://civilwar-history.fandom.com/wiki/William_Ward_Duffield).
Their primary responsibilities included advancing into Confederate-held
territories, securing key locations such as Frankfort, and pursuing
Confederate raiders like Morgan. Their movements were part of broader
Union efforts to assert control over strategic areas in Kentucky and
Tennessee during the fall of 1862.

### Later Life

After leaving the military, Thomas returned to Warren County. He married
Phoebe Ann Smith, and they lived in Ohio. He died in 1866.
