The [Plymouth Hereditary Society
(PHS)](https://newenglandsocieties.com/phs-eligibility/) is a lineage society
for descendants of individuals who established residence in one or more of the
eighteen towns of the Plymouth Colony between 1620 and 1691. It was founded
in 1990. Membership requires documentary proof of lineal descent from a resident
who lived in the Colony for at least one year. Rehoboth, the birthplace of my
qualifying ancestor, is among the recognized Colony towns.

## Phebe Lovell

[Phebe Lovell]([[Lowell-272|Phoebe (Lowell) Cook (1666-abt.1717)]]), also found
in records as Lowell, Lovewell, or Loven, was born on 25 December 1666 in
Rehoboth, Bristol County, Plymouth Colony. Her birth appears in the published
_Vital Records of Rehoboth, 1642â€“1896_, anchoring her identity within one of the
original towns of the Plymouth Colony. Though later genealogists have debated
her exact parentage, with some attributing her as a daughter of John Lovell and
Elizabeth Sylvester, the record evidence is not yet conclusive. The shifting
spellings of Lovell and Lovewell in seventeenth-century New England further
complicate the issue, but there is little doubt that the child born in Rehoboth
in 1666 is the woman later known as the wife of Andrew Cook.

On 24 July 1685, Phebe married Andrew Cook in Chelmsford, Middlesex County,
Massachusetts. Their early years together followed the frontier edge of
settlement, as towns like Dunstable, Chelmsford, and Watertown shifted in their
boundaries. The couple's son Andrew was born at Dunstable in 1687, and over the
next fifteen years they welcomed a large family. Elizabeth, Alice, Phebe, John,
Thomas, and Joseph Cook appear in compiled records and town registers, with the
family centered in western Middlesex County by the turn of the century. A
Sudbury town meeting entry of 29 November 1697 notes "Andrew Cook and wife
appeared," situating Phebe firmly in the community's daily governance. Later
records at Weston provide further glimpses of the family's presence and the
baptisms of younger children.

Beyond vital entries, Phebe emerges in land and probate transactions. On 26
December 1713, an agreement between Andrew Cook Jr. and his father Andrew Cook
Sr. outlined family property arrangements, obligations of support for parents,
and payments due to younger sons. Such documents give texture to the family's
domestic life and hint at Phebe's role as matriarch of a growing household. Most
telling is a deed dated 21 June 1723, in which Phebe surrendered her dower
rights to Joseph Lovell of Natick. This transaction proves that she was alive
after that date, extending her lifespan later than the "about 1717" death date
repeated in some secondary sources.

The story of Phebe's life is one of movement, continuity, and survival across
the shifting boundaries of Massachusetts towns. Born in the Plymouth Colony, she
married into the Cook family and raised children who would spread across New
England. Her known children include Andrew (d. 1721), Elizabeth, Alice, Phebe,
John, Deacon Thomas, and Joseph, many of whom are traceable into the
mid-eighteenth century through probate and land records. Together they represent
the continuation of a line that began in Plymouth Colony and extended through
the great migrations westward into New Hampshire, Ohio, Indiana, and beyond.

Although her burial place is not known, the documentary trail places Phebe
Lovell at the heart of colonial Massachusetts family life. She stands as an
example of the second generation born within the Plymouth Colony, bridging the
early years of Rehoboth's settlement with the emergence of new towns across
Middlesex County. Through her, I trace my membership in the Plymouth Hereditary
Society, recognizing the endurance of her line and the way her descendants
carried the Plymouth legacy into later centuries.

## Membership in the Society

Through Phebe Lovell's birth in Rehoboth and subsequent life across the
Middlesex County towns, my eligibility rests on her documented residence within
the Plymouth Colony timeframe and the continuation of the line forward through
New England and the Midwest. This page consolidates the core records that frame
Phebe's identity, family, and chronology within the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries.
