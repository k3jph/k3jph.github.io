The [Guild of Colonial Artisans and Tradesmen
1607-1783](https://guildcolonialartsandtrades.weebly.com/) (GCAT) honors
individuals descended from ancestors who practiced a craft, art, or trade in the
American Colonies from the founding of Jamestown in 1607 through the Treaty of
Paris in 1783. This lineage society celebrates the role of skilled artisans who
contributed to the economic and cultural development of the colonies and
recognizes descendants who continue to preserve this heritage.

## Jeremiah Cloud--Cordwainer

[Jeremiah Cloud](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cloud-113) (c. 1665-1717), born
in Calne, Wiltshire, England, was an early American cordwainer--an artisan who
specialized in crafting shoes from high-quality leather. He traveled to the
colonies with his father, [William
Cloud](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cloud-133), and brothers aboard the
*Unicorn* in 1682 as part of William Penn's migration initiative, arriving in
Pennsylvania. Their settlement helped lay the groundwork for early colonial
society in the Delaware Valley, contributing to the establishment of both
Pennsylvania and Delaware.

### Colonial Settlement and Community Building

Once settled in Chester County, Pennsylvania, Jeremiah took up the trade of
[cordwainer](https://cordwainers.org/) and became a respected member of the
community. As a skilled artisan, he provided essential goods, crafting durable,
high-quality shoes that met the needs of early settlers. Beyond his trade,
Jeremiah was also a foundational figure in the region's Quaker community,
participating actively in the [Concord Monthly
Meeting](https://www.pym.org/meetings/meeting/concord-monthly-meeting/).  His
and his family's presence in the Delaware Valley underscored the intertwined
relationship between skilled labor and community development that was critical
in early American settlements.

The Clouds were among the earliest settlers to venture into what is now
Delaware, where Jeremiah contributed to establishing stable settlements that
would support both Pennsylvania and Delaware's growth. His role in this
expansion effort included maintaining trade networks and supporting local
governance as the area developed from a sparsely populated frontier to a
structured colonial society.

### The Cordwainer's Craft

[Cordwainers](https://medium.com/the-billfold/life-after-shoe-college-interview-with-a-cordwainer-633b455dc7c9)
in the colonial era were highly skilled tradespeople responsible for producing
shoes and boots from newly tanned leather. Distinct from cobblers, who typically
repaired shoes, cordwainers were makers of new footwear and required extensive
training to master the craft. Jeremiah's work as a cordwainer involved selecting
the finest leathers and using specialized techniques to construct footwear that
would withstand the rigorous demands of colonial life.

Shoemaking required both physical strength and precision, with artisans spending
hours cutting, shaping, and stitching leather to form shoes that were not only
practical but also reflective of colonial fashion and status. Jeremiah's
expertise as a cordwainer meant he was an integral part of the local economy, as
reliable footwear was a necessity for travel, labor, and daily life. His craft
would have been indispensable for the settlers in Pennsylvania and Delaware,
providing comfort and durability in a challenging new environment.

### Legacy and Membership in GCAT

Jeremiah Cloud's life as a cordwainer and early settler in Pennsylvania and
Delaware embodies the resilience and skill of colonial artisans who supported
the development of thriving communities in the American colonies. His journey
from England to the New World, his role in establishing Delaware settlements,
and his mastery of cordwaining are central to my family's legacy. Through my
membership in the Guild of Colonial Artisans and Tradesmen, I honor Jeremiah's
contributions to the colonial economy and the lasting impact of his skilled
craft on American history.

## Christopher Taylor--Author

[Christopher Taylor](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Taylor-32362) (c. 1620–1686),
born in Skipton, Yorkshire, England, was a Quaker intellectual, schoolmaster,
and civic leader whose influence helped shape the early development of
Pennsylvania. Renowned for his classical education and deep commitment to Quaker
ideals, Taylor emigrated to the colony in 1682 and settled on Tinicum Island,
just south of present-day Philadelphia. His life reflects the essential role
that education, faith, and public service played in the foundation of William
Penn's "Holy Experiment."

### From Imprisonment to Emigration

A linguist and teacher fluent in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, [Taylor was
repeatedly jailed in
England](https://archive.org/details/historyofskipton00daws/page/299/mode/1up?view=theater)
for his religious beliefs. As a devout member of the Society of Friends, he
aligned himself with William Penn's vision for a Quaker-led colony in America.
In 1682, he sailed to Pennsylvania with his sons, acquiring land and quickly
becoming one of the most respected figures in the colony.

His landholdings included a substantial tract on Tinicum Island, formerly the
seat of New Sweden's government, where he established a home, a school, and a
base for civic life. In 1683, he was appointed to the Provincial Council and
served in the first Pennsylvania Assembly, [helping to shape the colony's early
legal and educational
institutions](https://www.pa-roots.com/2011/04/13/historyofdelawarecountychapter28/).

### A Teacher in the Wilderness

Taylor's most enduring legacy may lie in his role as a teacher. He offered
classical instruction to the children of settlers, including Latin, Greek, and
moral philosophy, training a generation of leaders in the Quaker tradition. At a
time when formal education was scarce, Taylor's school on Tinicum Island was one
of the earliest organized learning environments in the region.

He was known to conduct school in both his home and a separate structure built
for the purpose. His students included future civic leaders and fellow Friends,
and he emphasized literacy, scriptural understanding, and ethical conduct.

In addition to his teaching, Taylor authored several works that reflect his
scholarly pursuits and religious convictions:​

* _A Warning to this Nation_ (1655)
* _The Whirlwind of the Lord_ (1655)
* _[A Faithful and True Witness to the Light](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Faithful_and_True_Witness_to_the_light/kXNmAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)_ (1675)
* _An Epistle to Friends in Truth_ (1675)
* _[The Counterfeit Convert Discovered](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A35120.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext)_ (1676)
* _Institutiones Pietatis, with the Chief Principles of the Latin Tongue_ (1676)
* _[Compendium Trium Linguarum (Latin, Greek, and Hebrew)](https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1641-1700_compendium-trium-linguar_taylor-christopher_1679)_ (1679)
* _Testimony to the Lord's Power in Children_ (1679)
* _[An Epistle of Caution](https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1641-1700_an-epistle-of-caution-to_taylor-christopher_1681)_ (1681)
* _[Something in Answer](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A95027.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext)_ (1681)
* _[An Account of a Divine Visitation and Blessing](https://archive.org/details/bim_eighteenth-century_an-account-of-a-divine-v_1799)_ (1797, posthumously published)

### A Founding Mind of Pennsylvania

In addition to teaching, Taylor played a critical role in Pennsylvania's
governance. He helped interpret land titles, resolve disputes, and shape early
laws. William Penn personally respected him as "a man of great parts and
civility," often relying on his judgment in both legal and religious matters.

Taylor's home became a center for local Friends' meetings and community
activity, underscoring the dual importance of education and faith in early
Quaker settlements. His sons, Israel and Joseph Taylor, continued his legacy,
both becoming involved in Pennsylvania's civic and landowning affairs.

## Nathaniel Bonnell--Carpenter

[Nathaniel Bonnell](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bonnell-33) (c. 1630–c. 1696)
was a carpenter and early settler of Elizabethtown, New Jersey. Originally from
the New Haven Colony, he was among the signers of the Elizabethtown Associates'
agreement and established one of the first homes in the area. His house, located
on East Jersey Street, is believed to be the oldest surviving structure in
Elizabeth.

Bonnell practiced carpentry during a period when wood-frame construction was
central to settlement building in the mid-Atlantic colonies. His work likely
included the construction and maintenance of homes and other wooden structures
typical of early New England–influenced settlements. The survival of his house
offers one of the few material links to Elizabethtown's founding generation.

### Early History of Elizabethtown, New Jersey

Elizabethtown, established in 1664, was the first permanent English settlement
in what would become the Province of New Jersey. Located on the western shore of
Newark Bay, it was founded by settlers from the New Haven Colony following the
English seizure of New Netherland from the Dutch. The town was named in honor of
[Elizabeth Carteret](https://www.pepysdiary.com/encyclopedia/4039/), wife of Sir
George Carteret, one of the two original proprietors of New Jersey under the
grant from the Duke of York.

The settlement began with the purchase of land from the
[Lenape](https://collaborativehistory.gse.upenn.edu/stories/original-people-and-their-land-lenape-pre-history-18th-century),
formalized by the so-called Elizabethtown Purchase, though the legitimacy and
fairness of such transactions were often disputed by both Native inhabitants and
later colonial authorities. The signers of the [Elizabethtown
Associates'](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/elizabethtown-associates)
agreement laid out plots, established common lands, and adopted a town-based
model of governance influenced by New England traditions.

Elizabethtown served as the de facto capital of East Jersey until the
unification of East and West Jersey in 1702. It was an administrative and legal
center, home to colonial courts and the provincial governor’s residence for a
time. The town's early buildings were typically timber-framed, and its economy
was rooted in small-scale agriculture, trade, and artisanal labor.

Due to its strategic location, Elizabethtown also played a role in later
military conflicts, including the Revolutionary War, during which it saw
repeated skirmishes and occupations. The legacy of its founding
generation, landowners, craftsmen, and civic leadersm remains visible in the
surviving architectural and documentary record.
