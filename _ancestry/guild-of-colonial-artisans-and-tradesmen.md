The [Guild of Colonial Artisans and Tradesmen
1607-1783](https://guildcolonialartsandtrades.weebly.com/) (GCAT) honors
individuals descended from ancestors who practiced a craft, art, or trade in the
American Colonies from the founding of Jamestown in 1607 through the Treaty of
Paris in 1783. This lineage society celebrates the role of skilled artisans who
contributed to the economic and cultural development of the colonies and
recognizes descendants who continue to preserve this heritage.

## Jeremiah Cloud--Cordwainer

[Jeremiah Cloud](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cloud-113) (c. 1665-1717), born
in Calne, Wiltshire, England, was an early American cordwainer--an artisan who
specialized in crafting shoes from high-quality leather. He traveled to the
colonies with his father, [William
Cloud](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cloud-133), and brothers aboard the
*Unicorn* in 1682 as part of William Penn's migration initiative, arriving in
Pennsylvania. Their settlement helped lay the groundwork for early colonial
society in the Delaware Valley, contributing to the establishment of both
Pennsylvania and Delaware.

### Colonial Settlement and Community Building

Once settled in Chester County, Pennsylvania, Jeremiah took up the trade of
[cordwainer](https://cordwainers.org/) and became a respected member of the
community. As a skilled artisan, he provided essential goods, crafting durable,
high-quality shoes that met the needs of early settlers. Beyond his trade,
Jeremiah was also a foundational figure in the region's Quaker community,
participating actively in the [Concord Monthly
Meeting](https://www.pym.org/meetings/meeting/concord-monthly-meeting/).  His
and his family's presence in the Delaware Valley underscored the intertwined
relationship between skilled labor and community development that was critical
in early American settlements.

The Clouds were among the earliest settlers to venture into what is now
Delaware, where Jeremiah contributed to establishing stable settlements that
would support both Pennsylvania and Delaware's growth. His role in this
expansion effort included maintaining trade networks and supporting local
governance as the area developed from a sparsely populated frontier to a
structured colonial society.

### The Cordwainer's Craft

[Cordwainers](https://medium.com/the-billfold/life-after-shoe-college-interview-with-a-cordwainer-633b455dc7c9)
in the colonial era were highly skilled tradespeople responsible for producing
shoes and boots from newly tanned leather. Distinct from cobblers, who typically
repaired shoes, cordwainers were makers of new footwear and required extensive
training to master the craft. Jeremiah's work as a cordwainer involved selecting
the finest leathers and using specialized techniques to construct footwear that
would withstand the rigorous demands of colonial life.

Shoemaking required both physical strength and precision, with artisans spending
hours cutting, shaping, and stitching leather to form shoes that were not only
practical but also reflective of colonial fashion and status. Jeremiah's
expertise as a cordwainer meant he was an integral part of the local economy, as
reliable footwear was a necessity for travel, labor, and daily life. His craft
would have been indispensable for the settlers in Pennsylvania and Delaware,
providing comfort and durability in a challenging new environment.

### Legacy and Membership in GCAT

Jeremiah Cloud's life as a cordwainer and early settler in Pennsylvania and
Delaware embodies the resilience and skill of colonial artisans who supported
the development of thriving communities in the American colonies. His journey
from England to the New World, his role in establishing Delaware settlements,
and his mastery of cordwaining are central to my family's legacy. Through my
membership in the Guild of Colonial Artisans and Tradesmen, I honor Jeremiah's
contributions to the colonial economy and the lasting impact of his skilled
craft on American history.
