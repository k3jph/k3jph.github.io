The [Sons and Daughters of the Colonial and Antebellum Bench and Bar
1565–1861](https://benchbar.us/) is a hereditary society honoring descendants of
individuals who served in the lands now comprising the continental United States
as judges or lawyers prior to April 12, 1861. The society encourages
genealogical and historical research into the early American legal profession
and the courts that supported colonial and early national governance.

## John Hoar (c1622–1704)

My membership is in right of [John Hoar
(c1622–1704)](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoar-9), of Concord, Massachusetts.
John Hoar was born in Gloucester, England, about 1622. A record of
apprenticeship in 1633 implies he was about eleven years old at that time. By
the early 1640s he had come to Massachusetts with his widowed mother and was
established in Scituate no later than 1643, when he appears among the town's men
bearing arms.

In 1659 he removed to Concord, where he became known not only as a militia
figure, but also as someone willing to deal directly with Native communities in
a period when that could be socially and physically dangerous. One episode
recorded in later summaries is his effort, during [King Philip's
War](https://www.americanhistorycentral.com/entries/king-philips-war-1675/),
to offer shelter to John Eliot's "Praying Indians," an act that helped establish
his reputation as an intermediary, even though his neighbors thwarted the
attempt and the forced removal to Deer Island proved catastrophic for many of
those confined there. 

Hoar's most famous public act came in the crisis surrounding [Mary Rowlandson's
captivity](https://www.masshist.org/beehiveblog/2013/02/mary-rowlandsons-dolefullest-day/).
Rowlandson was taken in the Lancaster attack of February 1676 and held for weeks
while her captors moved through central Massachusetts. Hoar, described in
summary accounts as a prominent lawyer (and, in some tellings, a missionary),
was asked to act as the colonial representative in negotiations for her release.
He set out from Lancaster in late April 1676, traveling with Native guides to
meet the war party near what is now Princeton. On May 2, 1676, Rowlandson was
released at the granite outcropping now known as [Redemption
Rock](https://thetrustees.org/place/redemption-rock), following an agreement for
ransom that later tradition commonly describes as £20, and that at least one
contemporary-derived account itemizes in goods and money.

The physical memorialization of this event has its own afterlife. A Princeton
Historical Society account notes that [U.S. Senator George F.
Hoar](https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/H000654), identified as a
descendant of John Hoar, purchased Redemption Rock and adjacent land in 1879 and
caused an inscription to be cut into the stone recording the May 2, 1676
agreement for Rowlandson's ransom. 

Hoar died in Concord on April 2, 1704. He is also remembered locally as the
first inhabitant of the house later known as [Orchard House, later associated
with Louisa May Alcott](https://louisamayalcott.org/), which is an appropriately
odd footnote for a man whose life already reads like a stitched-together
anthology of colonial New England.
