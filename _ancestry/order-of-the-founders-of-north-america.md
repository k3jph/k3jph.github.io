The [Order of the Founders of North
America](https://www.foundersofna.org/) (OFNA) is a hereditary society
dedicated to preserving the legacy of individuals who played significant
roles in the early settlement and development of North America. This
esteemed lineage society celebrates the contributions of these founders,
ensuring their efforts remain a vital part of the historical narrative.

The OFNA promotes the study of early North American history and fosters
the preservation of historical documents, sites, and artifacts
associated with the nation's founders. Members of the society work
collaboratively to educate the public about the achievements of these
pioneers, while also providing a space for descendants to connect and
honor their shared heritage.

## George Chappell

[George Chappell](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Chappell-1058), an early settler
and builder of colonial Connecticut, is a figure whose legacy reflects the
resilience and determination of those who shaped the early history of North
America.  Born in England around 1615, Chappell emigrated during the [Great
Migration](https://www.americanancestors.org/new-englands-great-migration), a
period between 1620 and 1640 when tens of thousands of English Puritans sought
refuge in New England. His life and work provide a window into the challenges
and triumphs of colonial life, particularly in the Connecticut River Valley.

### Arrival in the New World

[Little is known about Chappell's early life in
England](https://www.americanancestors.org/databases/new-england-historical-and-genealogical-register/image?pageName=48&volumeId=11640&filterQuery=page:6),
but his decision to embark on the perilous journey across the Atlantic
speaks to his fortitude and ambition. Like many of his contemporaries,
he was likely motivated by a combination of religious conviction,
economic opportunity, and the promise of land ownership--an unattainable
dream for many in England's rigid social hierarchy.

Chappell came aboard [_Christian de
London_](https://chipstone.org/article.php/277/american-furniture-2005/fashioning-furniture-and-framing-community:-woodworkers-and-the-rise-of-a-connecticut-river-valley-town)
and the Chappell initially settled in Massachusetts, where the burgeoning
colonies around the [Massachusetts Bay](https://www.ushistory.org/us/3c.asp) and
[Plymouth](https://plimoth.org/) offered a foothold for new arrivals. By the
early 1640s, he had moved to Wethersfield, Connecticut, one of the oldest towns
in the state and a critical hub for trade and settlement in the [Connecticut
Colony](https://connecticuthistory.org/the-importance-of-being-puritan-church-and-state-in-colonial-connecticut/).

### Life in Wethersfield

[Wethersfield](https://www.wethersfieldhistory.org/articles/wethersfield-a-history/)
was established in 1634 by Puritan settlers seeking fertile land along
the Connecticut River. By the time Chappell arrived, the settlement was
growing but still required significant labor and resources to thrive. As
a carpenter and planter, Chappell's skills were vital to the community.
The dual roles of farming and craftsmanship were typical in early
colonial life, where self-sufficiency was a necessity, and every
contribution supported the survival of the settlement.

Historical records from the mid-1600s document Chappell's landholdings,
indicating that he was not only a laborer but also a landowner--a mark
of success and stability in the colonial era. Owning property was not
just an economic advantage; it also conferred social standing and a
voice in local governance, similar to the [gentry of the
England](https://academic.oup.com/book/5072/chapter/147623614) Chappell
left. Chappell's land in Wethersfield likely supported subsistence
crops, livestock, and possibly trade goods, contributing to the economic
growth of the colony.

### Community Contributions

Beyond his personal achievements, George Chappell was part of the
collective effort that turned Wethersfield into a thriving community.
Early settlers faced challenges ranging from harsh winters and food
shortages to conflicts with Indigenous peoples and internal disputes
over governance and land. These hardships necessitated cooperation and
mutual support, values that were deeply ingrained in [Puritan
society](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/puritan.htm).

Although detailed records of Chappell's civic involvement are sparse,
his presence in Wethersfield during its formative years suggests he was
an active participant in the settlement's development. The early
settlers' collective labor laid the groundwork for Wethersfield's
emergence as a significant agricultural and trading center.

## Membership in the Order

George Chappell's legacy is not only preserved in the records of
colonial Connecticut but also through his descendants, who carried his
pioneering spirit into subsequent generations. Many of his descendants
played roles in the continued development of the colonies and, later,
the United States. Chappell's story is emblematic of the broader
narrative of early American settlers--individuals who, through
determination and resourcefulness, helped establish the foundation for a
new society.

Organizations like the Order of the Founders of North America honor
individuals like George Chappell by preserving their stories and
celebrating their contributions to the formation of North America.
Membership in such societies is not merely a genealogical
accomplishment; it is a means of connecting with history and ensuring
that the sacrifices and achievements of early settlers are not
forgotten.
