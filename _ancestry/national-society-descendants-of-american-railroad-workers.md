The [National Society Descendants of American Railroad
Workers](https://www.nsdrailroad.com) (NSDARW) was formed in 2021 to
honor and preserve the legacy of our ancestors who contributed to the
development of the railroad systems in the United States, Mexico, and
Canada. Membership in this society celebrates the contributions of those
whose labor enabled the expansion of our country and its economic
growth.

## Harry Lee Williams

Harry Lee Williams was born in August 1885 in Indiana, the eldest child of
Thornton Robert Williams and Ida May Adams. He spent his early years in
Reynolds, Honey Creek Township, White County, Indiana, where he appeared in the
1900 U.S. Census at age 15, living with his parents and siblings. His family
roots extended through Indiana and Virginia, and by 1900, they were part of a
rural farming community in northern Indiana.

On November 11, 1907, Harry married Julia McNeal in Covington, Kenton County,
Kentucky. While the marriage took place across the river, all records show that
Harry and Julia were residents of Cincinnati, Ohio, and likely chose Covington
for its simplified marriage laws, a common choice for Ohio couples at the time.
Kentucky offered fewer bureaucratic hurdles, including no waiting period and
more relaxed residency requirements, making it a popular destination for quick
and discreet ceremonies.

Harry and Julia settled permanently in Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, where
they raised a growing family. Their children included Helen, Ida, Earl, William,
and Thornton Robert Williams, born between 1908 and 1916. Census records from
1910 through 1940 consistently place the family in Cincinnati's Ward 19, a
working-class neighborhood close to rail and industrial infrastructure.

Harry's professional life was defined by his work as a locomotive engineer, a
position of responsibility and technical skill. By the time of his World War I
draft registration in 1917, he was employed by the [Cleveland, Cincinnati,
Chicago & St. Louis Railway](http://madisonrails.railfan.net/bigfour.html)
(CCC&StL), commonly known as the Big Four Railroad. This line, which was fully
absorbed into the [New York Central](https://nycshs.org/) system, maintained a
major Chicago Division, where Harry was assigned. Although his work may have
involved travel or temporary duty in Chicago, his home remained in Cincinnati
throughout his career.  He continued to work in the railroad industry for
decades, a steady presence in an era of American expansion and
industrialization. By the time of the 1942 World War II draft registration,
Harry was still living in Cincinnati and working for the New York Central.

Harry Lee Williams died in Cincinnati on February 19, 1950, at the age of 64. He
was buried a few days later, on February 23, in [Spring Grove
Cemetery](https://www.springgrove.org/), one of the most historic burial grounds
in Ohio. His life, spanning the Gilded Age, two World Wars, and the golden era
of American rail, reflects the path of a working man who helped build and move
the nation, one mile of track at a time.

## About the Society

The NSDARW was founded by Amanda Morris and Christopher Bowen in
February 2021 in the state of Virginia. The society's mission is to
honor the ancestors of its members who were involved in building,
maintaining, organizing, or administrating railroads, commuter rails, or
streetcar systems in North America during the period between March 1,
1825, and December 31, 1950. The NSDARW's dedication extends beyond
genealogical documentation to include educational programming and
support for historical preservation efforts tied to American railroad
history.

The motto of the society, "The journey is just as important as the
destination," reflects the values and spirit of the railroad workers who
connected cities, industries, and people. By preserving and sharing
these stories, the society ensures that the contributions of railroad
workers are not forgotten.

## Membership Eligibility and Purpose

Membership in the NSDARW is open to any individual over the age of
eighteen who can prove lineal descent from a railroad worker who
contributed to the development of the railroads in the United States,
Mexico, or Canada. Eligible roles include a wide variety of positions
such as engineers, conductors, telegraphers, station agents, and more.
The aim of the NSDARW is not only to honor the past but also to engage
in educational, charitable, historical, genealogical, patriotic,
literary, and social activities that celebrate the railroad and its
employees.

The NSDARW's purpose is encapsulated in their motto and in their
commitment to:

- Identifying and honoring ancestors who were railroad workers.
- Collecting and sharing records, documents, and photos about the
  history of these workers.
- Supporting educational and historical activities that preserve
  railroad heritage.

## Legacy

My acceptance into the National Society Descendants of American Railroad
Workers allows me to honor the legacy of Harry Lee Williams and
recognize his long-standing contributions to the railroad industry. This
membership is not just a celebration of his life but also a continuation
of my effort to preserve and document the rich history of my family and
its role in American industry.

*Additional memberships will be added as they are approved.*
