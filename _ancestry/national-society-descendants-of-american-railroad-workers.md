The [National Society Descendants of American Railroad
Workers](https://www.nsdrailroad.com) (NSDARW) was formed in 2021 to
honor and preserve the legacy of our ancestors who contributed to the
development of the railroad systems in the United States, Mexico, and
Canada. Membership in this society celebrates the contributions of those
whose labor enabled the expansion of our country and its economic
growth.

## Harry Lee Williams

[Harry Lee Williams](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Williams-143061), my
great-grandfather, served as a locomotive engineer for over 30 years.
While the specific railroad company remains uncertain, it is believed to
have been either the [Baltimore and Ohio Railroad](https://borhs.org/)
or the [Louisville and Nashville Railroad](http://www.lnrr.org/), as
both companies were closely associated with my family. Despite
challenges in retrieving detailed employment recordsâ€”due to an empty
file from the [Railroad Retirement Board]()--the legacy of Harry's work and
dedication is clear. He worked as an engineer up until his death in
1950, embodying the spirit of service and dedication that the NSDARW
aims to preserve.

## About the Society

The NSDARW was founded by Amanda Morris and Christopher Bowen in
February 2021 in the state of Virginia. The society's mission is to
honor the ancestors of its members who were involved in building,
maintaining, organizing, or administrating railroads, commuter rails, or
streetcar systems in North America during the period between March 1,
1825, and December 31, 1950. The NSDARW's dedication extends beyond
genealogical documentation to include educational programming and
support for historical preservation efforts tied to American railroad
history.

The motto of the society--*"The journey is just as important as the
destination"*--reflects the values and spirit of the railroad workers who
connected cities, industries, and people. By preserving and sharing
these stories, the society ensures that the contributions of railroad
workers are not forgotten.

## Membership Eligibility and Purpose

Membership in the NSDARW is open to any individual over the age of
eighteen who can prove lineal descent from a railroad worker who
contributed to the development of the railroads in the United States,
Mexico, or Canada. Eligible roles include a wide variety of positions
such as engineers, conductors, telegraphers, station agents, and more.
The aim of the NSDARW is not only to honor the past but also to engage
in educational, charitable, historical, genealogical, patriotic,
literary, and social activities that celebrate the railroad and its
employees.

The NSDARW's purpose is encapsulated in their motto and in their
commitment to:

- Identifying and honoring ancestors who were railroad workers.
- Collecting and sharing records, documents, and photos about the
  history of these workers.
- Supporting educational and historical activities that preserve
  railroad heritage.

## Legacy

My acceptance into the National Society Descendants of American Railroad
Workers allows me to honor the legacy of Harry Lee Williams and
recognize his long-standing contributions to the railroad industry. This
membership is not just a celebration of his life but also a continuation
of my effort to preserve and document the rich history of my family and
its role in American industry.

*Additional memberships will be added as they are approved.*
