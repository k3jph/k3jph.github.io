## Joseph Newman and Rebecca Pugh

[Joseph Newman](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Newman-16482) was an early
settler of Warren County, Ohio, establishing himself in Waynesville
by 1829. Born on December 4, 1809, Joseph played a key role in the
agricultural development of the region. He married [Rebecca
Pugh](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Pugh-6276) on December 19, 1829, in
Warren County, solidifying his family's deep roots in the community. He
acquired land in the area and contributed to the county's farming and
civic life. His legacy continued through his children, including
Benjamin Franklin Newman, who further expanded the family's presence in
the county.

### Land and Settlement

Joseph Newman's land records date back to 1829, documenting his presence
and economic activities in Warren County. Census records, tax rolls, and
property deeds affirm his role as a landowner and an early member of the
Waynesville community. His homestead remained in the family for
generations, underscoring the lasting influence of the Newman family in
Warren County.

### Family and Legacy

Joseph and Rebecca Newman had several children, among them [Benjamin

born in Warren County in 1838. Through this lineage, the family's
contributions to the county continued well into the late 19th and early
20th centuries.  Joseph Newman was the son of Jonathan Newman and Anne
