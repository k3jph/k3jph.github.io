The [Order of the First Families of
Connecticut](https://newenglandsocieties.com/) (OFFCT) honors descendants of
those who settled in Connecticut before the granting of the [Royal Charter in
1662](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/ct03.asp). Founded to preserve
the memory of these early families, the Order recognizes individuals who played
a formative role in the creation of the colony's civic, religious, and legal
traditions. Membership in OFFCT reflects not only a genealogical connection but
also a shared commitment to studying and honoring the origins of Connecticut as
a distinctive political and cultural entity in early America.

Connecticut's colonial story is unique among the New England colonies. It began
as a collection of independent settlements, most notably Hartford (1636), New
Haven (1638), and Saybrook (1635), each with its own governance and religious
orientation. New Haven, in particular, stood apart as a rigid Puritan theocracy
that resisted incorporation into the more moderate Connecticut Colony. The 1662
royal charter unified these separate colonies under a single government, laying
the foundation for Connecticut's enduring identity. The settlers recognized by
OFFCT were the architects of this world: men and women who cleared land, built
meetinghouses, governed towns, and passed on a legacy of self-rule, covenant
theology, and communal resilience.

## Susanna Whitehead

[Susanna Whitehead](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Whitehead-407) was born on 5
August 1650 in [New Haven
Colony](https://connecticuthistory.org/a-separate-place-the-new-haven-colony-1638-1665/),
the daughter of Samuel Whitehead, a prominent early settler and town official,
and his wife, Susanna (surname unknown). Samuel Whitehead arrived in New Haven
by 1639 and served as a deputy to the General Court, a juror, and a trusted
member of the town's governance. His civic prominence placed the family among
the Puritan elite of the colony, and his wife—though largely absent from
surviving records, would have been responsible for managing household affairs,
raising children, and supporting her husband's civic duties.

On 3 January 1665, Susanna married Nathaniel Bunnell, likely the son of William
Bunnell, also of New Haven. Their marriage took place during a transformative
period: the forced unification of New Haven with the [Connecticut
Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Colony) under the 1662 royal
charter. Many families, including the Bunnells, subsequently migrated to
Elizabethtown, New Jersey, a newly established settlement in East Jersey with
strong New England roots.

In Elizabethtown, Susanna and Nathaniel raised a family whose descendants would
spread across the early American frontier. From their origins in Puritan New
England, the family moved through New Jersey and into the Ohio River Valley and
the Midwest. Susanna died on 12 February 1733/4 in Essex County, New Jersey, at
the age of 83.

## A Note on Lineage and Legacy

In geographic-based hereditary societies, descent is often traced through the
paternal line, frequently omitting women as primary qualifying ancestors, even
when their presence is equally foundational. In submitting this line of descent
through **Susanna Whitehead**, I am intentionally acknowledging the vital role
women played in building and sustaining colonial communities. Though less often
named in land records or officeholding, women like Susanna were indispensable to
early American settlement, and their stories deserve equal recognition.

Susanna's life, spanning theocratic New Haven, royal incorporation, and migration
to New Jersey, reflects the breadth of colonial experience in the 17th and early
18th centuries. Her legacy lives on through generations of descendants,
including:

- [Nathaniel Bonnell](/ancestry/guild-of-colonial-artisans-and-tradesmen)
  (1670-1736), carpenter of Elizabeth New Jersey
- [Barzilla Bunnell](/ancestry/first-families-of-ohio) (1807–1891) of White
  County, Indiana
- Rebecca Elizabeth Bunnell (1835–1913), whose line continued through the
  [Williams](ancestry/national-society-descendants-of-american-railroad-workers)
  and Howard families

These descendants carried forward Susanna's legacy, quietly but powerfully
shaping American life from Connecticut to the Midwest.
