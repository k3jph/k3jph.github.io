The [Victorian Families of Miami
County](https://sites.rootsweb.com/~ohmchgs/mchgs_recognition.html)
lineage society honors the descendants of individuals who lived in Miami
County, Ohio, from January 1, 1851, to December 31, 1880.

## Louisa Hearn

[Louisa Hearn](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hearn-902), married to
Henry Cavender in Miami County in 1854, qualifies for membership in this
society. Her marriage record serves as the primary proof of her
residence during this time period.

While Louisa Hearn (alternatively recorded as "Louisa Hearon" in some
records) is believed to be connected to Charles Wesley Cavender, there
are unresolved details regarding her exact relationship. Although she
appears in marriage records, there is inconclusive evidence to
definitively establish Louisa Hearn as the mother of Charles Wesley
Cavender. Furthermore, a discrepancy in the spelling of her name--whether
"Hearn" or "Hearon"--raises questions about whether these are variant
spellings of the same individual or if they refer to two distinct
people. 

## Sarah Jane Rinehart 

[Sarah Jane Rinehart](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rhinehart-727)
married William Henry Harrison Martin in 1862, becoming a part of Miami
County's history during the Victorian era.  Their marriage, documented
in local records, places Sarah within the broader lineage of Miami
County families during this time. William, a qualifying ancestor of the
[Pioneers and Settlers](/ancestry/psmc) lineage society, further
establishes the family's deep connection to the county. While specific
details about Sarahâ€™s life are not widely available, her inclusion in
the genealogical records through her marriage highlights the family's
continued presence in the region during a period of significant
historical change.

This membership celebrates the lives of individuals like Louisa, who contributed to the county's history during the Victorian era, and helps preserve their stories for future generations.
