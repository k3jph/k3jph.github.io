The [Descendants of Miners 1607–1907](https://www.descendantsofminers.org/) is a
hereditary society dedicated to  honoring and preserving the legacy of
individuals who contributed to the mining industry in the present-day  United
States between 1607 and 1907. Membership in this society recognizes the
descendants of those who worked in mining-related fields, including miners,
stonecutters, freight train workers servicing mines, and those involved in the
mercantile economy of mining communities.

## Alexander C. Snyder

[Alexander C. Snyder](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Snyder-19408) (1823–1905)
was a stonecutter who worked in the mining industry during the late 19th
century. In the 1880 U.S. Census, he is recorded as a stonecutter, a trade that
played a crucial role in mining operations by providing the expertise necessary
for processing quarried materials and shaping stone for industrial and
construction use. 

Earlier in his life, Alexander worked as a farmer, demonstrating the
adaptability and resilience characteristic of many early American laborers. By
the 1880s, he had transitioned into stonecutting, contributing to the
infrastructure and industrial development of his region. His work as a
stonecutter places him within the broader network of tradespeople who were
essential to the mining and resource extraction economy of 19th-century America.

## Legacy and Future Research Opportunities

Membership in the Descendants of Miners commemorates Alexander C. Snyder's
contributions to the labor history of the United States. His documented work in
the mining industry ensures that his role in shaping the industrial economy is
remembered and honored. 

Further research into census records, land deeds, and local industrial histories
may provide additional insights into Alexander's career and personal life, as
well as those of his wife, [Sena
DeMoss](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/DeMoss-870), whom legend suggests was
descendant of Huguenot immigrants from France. Identifying the specific mining
operations or stonecutting firms where he worked could deepen the historical
understanding of his contributions.

By recognizing miners and those in supporting roles, the Descendants of Miners
1607–1907 ensures that the vital role of laborers in the nation's industrial
past is preserved for future generations.
