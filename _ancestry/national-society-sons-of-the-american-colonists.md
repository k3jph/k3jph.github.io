The [National Society, Sons of the American
Colonists](https://www.americancolonists.org/) honors men who can demonstrate
lineal descent from colonists living in what became the United States during
the colonial period. The Society was organized in 1956, reorganized in 1986,
and remains focused on promoting awareness of the people who shaped the early
American colonies.

Members support the preservation of colonial records and historic sites,
encourage research into the colonial period, and help sustain libraries and
archives devoted to early American history. The Society maintains a lineage
record of qualifying ancestors and their descendants, ensuring that the stories
of early settlers continue to be documented and shared.

## Robert Willson of West Jersey

My qualifying ancestor for the National Society, Sons of the American Colonists
is [Robert Willson of Chesterfield
Township](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Willson-169), who was born about 1650
in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England. He married Ann Stainridge, widow of Robert
Witham, under the care of the Society of Friends in Scarborough in 1672. The
Yorkshire Quaker registers preserve the record of the marriage, and his early
life in England is treated in [_The Willson Family,
1672–1979_](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112087529652).

Quaker records report that Robert was dismissed from the Scarborough Meeting in
1682 to the care of Friends in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Family tradition
maintains that Robert and Ann, with their children, sailed for America in 1682
on the ship _Welcome_, arriving at Philadelphia and settling shortly afterward
along Crosswicks Creek in what became Burlington County.

The first surviving legal reference to Robert in New Jersey appears in a 1684
survey of land on the south side of Crosswicks Creek, which describes the tract
as adjoining property already held by him. Over the following years, he
expanded his holdings in and near Burlington, including a share of a West
Jersey propriety and a later purchase of 260 acres from Richard and Susanna
Stockton. These activities appear throughout the early land records preserved
in the _West Jersey Records_ and related archival materials.

The family also brought with them a notable heirloom, [a "Breeches Bible"
printed](https://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library) in 1606 and
1618 and inscribed "John Willson his book."  Several family signatures appear
in the volume, providing a rare personal link between their English and
American lives.

Robert was active in the newly formed Chesterfield Monthly Meeting beginning 
in 1684. He was appointed to help settle disputes among Friends, served as a
trustee of the burial ground at Crosswicks, and represented the meeting at
Quarterly Meeting. His name appears frequently in the Chesterfield minutes,
which chart his participation in the life of the Quaker community for more than
two decades.

In civil affairs, Robert held several local offices. He was chosen constable of
Chesterfield Township in 1688 and served on the grand jury at Burlington that
same year. He later sat in the General Assembly of West Jersey during the
legislative sessions of 1696 and 1697, appearing among the Quaker members of
the House of Representatives. These roles place him firmly within the civic
structure of early West Jersey and form the basis of his qualification for this
Society.

Robert made a nuncupative will in March 1708/9, naming his wife Ann, his son
Samuel, his daughter Rebecca, and several grandchildren. An inventory taken
later in 1709 included the estates of both Robert and Ann, suggesting that she
died not long after him. My descent continues through their son, Samuel Willson
I, whose family carried forward the Willson presence along Crosswicks Creek.
