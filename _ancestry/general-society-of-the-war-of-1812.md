The [General Society of the War of 1812](https://gswar1812.org/) is a lineage
society dedicated to preserving the memory and contributions of those who served
during the War of 1812. Founded in 1814, the society fosters the remembrance of
the war's significance and honors the patriots who defended American
independence during this pivotal period. Membership is extended to male
descendants of veterans who served in military or naval forces during the
conflict, ensuring their sacrifices are not forgotten.

## Private William Ray – 2nd Regiment, Ohio Militia

[William Ray](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ray-3368) (1790–1843) served as a
private in the 2nd Regiment, [Ohio
Militia](https://archive.org/details/northernohioduri00west), under Captain
Peter Bacus during the War of 1812. Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina,
William later moved to Ohio, where he played an integral role in the young
state's defense against British forces and their Native American allies. His
service spanned from August 19, 1812, to February 24, 1813, during which the
Ohio Militia contributed to securing the Northwest Territory and protecting
settlements along the frontier.

### Military Service Highlights

Private William Ray's unit, part of the Ohio Militia, served during a time when
the United States was fighting to maintain its sovereignty and protect its
western borders. The militia engaged in activities such as fortifying defenses,
engaging enemy forces, and providing logistical support to the regular army.
William's dedication to his community and his nation reflects the spirit of the
citizen-soldiers who were instrumental in the war effort.

### Family Legacy

William married [Sarah Bentch](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bentch-5) on April
19, 1814, in Ross County, Ohio, shortly after his service. The couple had eleven
children and settled in Jackson County, Ohio, where William became a respected
community member until his death in 1843.  His life and service are commemorated
at Ray Cemetery in Byer, Ohio.

William Ray was the grandson of [Moses
Teague](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Teague-228), a patriot who served during
the Revolutionary War, and the great-great-grandson of [Edward
Teague](/ancestry/offm), an early settler of Maryland. The Teague family's
multigenerational commitment to defending and shaping the United States
highlights a legacy of service and dedication that William upheld during the War
of 1812.

## About the Society of the War of 1812 in Maryland 

The Society of the War of 1812 in Maryland originated from the "Defenders of
Baltimore," a group formed by veterans who repelled British forces during the
Battle of Baltimore and was organized on September 14, 1814.  As the number of
surviving veterans declined, their descendants sought to continue the legacy.
This led to the incorporation of the Society of the War of 1812 in Maryland on
October 25, 1893, allowing male descendants of veterans to join and perpetuate
the society's objectives.

The Maryland Society focuses on:

 * Collecting and preserving rolls, records, books, and other documents relating
   to the War of 1812
 * Encouraging research and the preservation of historical data, including
   memorials to patriots of that era
 * Caring for the graves of veterans of the War of 1812
 * Fostering true patriotism and love of country

By maintaining these objectives, the Society of the War of 1812 in Maryland
ensures that the rich history of Maryland’s contributions to the War of 1812
remains an integral part of the state’s heritage.

## About the General Society of the War of 1812

The General Society of the War of 1812 traces its origins to two primary sources:

* Maryland Society: Organized on September 14, 1814, in Baltimore, Maryland, by
  veterans who had successfully defended Fort McHenry during the War of 1812
* Pennsylvania Society: Established on January 9, 1854, in Philadelphia,
  Pennsylvania, by a group of veterans who convened at Independence Hall

These two societies, along with delegates from New York, Massachusetts, and
Connecticut, met in Philadelphia on April 14, 1894, to form the General Society
of the War of 1812. They chose to recognize September 14, 1814, as the official
establishment date, honoring the Maryland Society's original formation.

The objectives of the General Society include:

 * Preserving historical records, documents, and memorabilia related to the War
   of 1812
 * Erecting and maintaining monuments and markers in memory of War of 1812
   veterans
 * Promoting patriotic education to ensure future generations understand the
   significance of the war
 * Supporting research and genealogical efforts to document the lives and
   contributions of War of 1812 veterans

As one of the oldest lineage societies in the United States, the General Society
has upheld its mission to preserve the legacy of this pivotal chapter in
American history for over two centuries.

*Additional memberships will be added as they are approved.*
