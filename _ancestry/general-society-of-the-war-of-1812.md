## Private William Ray – 2nd Regiment, Ohio Militia

[William Ray](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ray-3368) (1790–1843) served as a
private in the 2nd Regiment, [Ohio
Militia](https://archive.org/details/northernohioduri00west), under Captain
Peter Bacus during the War of 1812. Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina,
William later moved to Ohio, where he played an integral role in the young
state's defense against British forces and their Native American allies. His
service spanned from August 19, 1812, to February 24, 1813, during which the
Ohio Militia contributed to securing the Northwest Territory and protecting
settlements along the frontier.

### Military Service Highlights

Private William Ray's unit, part of the Ohio Militia, served during a time when
the United States was fighting to maintain its sovereignty and protect its
western borders. The militia engaged in activities such as fortifying defenses,
engaging enemy forces, and providing logistical support to the regular army.
William's dedication to his community and his nation reflects the spirit of the
citizen-soldiers who were instrumental in the war effort.

### Family Legacy

William married [Sarah Bentch](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bentch-5) on April
19, 1814, in Ross County, Ohio, shortly after his service. The couple had eleven
children and settled in Jackson County, Ohio, where William became a respected
community member until his death in 1843.  His life and service are commemorated
at Ray Cemetery in Byer, Ohio.

William Ray was the grandson of [Moses
Teague](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Teague-228), a patriot who served during
the Revolutionary War, and the great-great-grandson of [Edward
Teague](/ancestry/offm), an early settler of Maryland. The Teague family's
multigenerational commitment to defending and shaping the United States
highlights a legacy of service and dedication that William upheld during the War
of 1812.
