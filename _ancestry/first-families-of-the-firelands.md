The [First Families of the
Firelands](https://www.hcc-ogs.org/first-families.html) is a heritage program
administered by the [Firelands Genealogical Society](https://www.hcc-ogs.org/),
a chapter of the Ohio Genealogical Society. It honors those whose ancestors
settled in the Firelands, a region in northern Ohio encompassing present-day
Huron and Erie Counties, during the region’s foundational eras. These lands
trace their roots to the aftermath of the American Revolutionary War, when the
state of [Connecticut awarded tracts of land in the far Western
Reserve](https://case.edu/ech/articles/w/western-reserve) to citizens whose
homes had been burned by British forces, especially during the coastal raids of
1779-1781. Known originally as the "Sufferers’ Lands," this area came to be
called the Firelands, and it was gradually opened to New England settlers
seeking new opportunities in the early 19th century.

The Firelands developed with a distinct character, culturally shaped by its New
England roots and geographically defined by the southern shore of Lake Erie. As
towns like Norwalk, Milan, and Sandusky grew, the area became known for its
educational institutions, small industries, and participation in progressive
social causes. Milan, for example, was briefly one of the busiest ports in the
United States during the mid-1800s due to its canal connection and shipbuilding
economy.

By 1900, when my ancestor Mina Hall appears in the records of Perkins Township,
Erie County, the region had entered a new phase of development. The city of
Sandusky had emerged as a major commercial hub, with electric streetcars, active
railroad connections, and a growing tourist trade fueled by nearby attractions
like Cedar Point. Rural townships retained their agricultural foundations but
were increasingly tied to regional markets. Life for working-class residents,
particularly young women like Mina, often meant employment in domestic service
or local industry. Erie County's social fabric in 1900 reflected both the
aspirations of the Progressive Era and the lingering hardships of 19th-century
rural life.

Membership in First Families recognizes ancestors who lived in the Firelands
prior to 1860 under the categories of First Pioneer (pre-1820), First Settler
(1820-1860), or Century Ancestor (living 100+ years ago). 

## Mina Elizabeth Hall--Century Ancestor

My qualifying ancestor, **Mina Elizabeth Hall**, was born in Paulding County,
Ohio, in 1888. She endured considerable hardship in early life, losing her
mother at the age of one and her father by the time she was four. By the age of
14, the 1900 United States Census records show her living in **Perkins Township,
Erie County**, Ohio, listed as a "servant" in a household whose identity has
been lost to living memory.

Though her presence in Erie County was humble and undocumented by family lore
until recent research, it now stands as part of the historical record. Her life
reflects the resilience of many young women of the period who found work in
service households as a means of survival and opportunity. Mina later married
[Charles Franklin Cavender and continued her life in Ohio](/ogs/ffo), raising a
family that included my maternal grandmother.
