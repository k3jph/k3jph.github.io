The [First Families of Jackson County
(Ohio)](https://jacksoncountyohiogen.com/lineage-societies/) is a lineage
society of the Jackson County Genealogical Society dedicated to recognizing
descendants of individuals who resided in Jackson County on or before December
31, 1830. The society exists to preserve the documentary record of the county's
earliest families and to encourage careful, source-based genealogical research
grounded in original records.

Membership is extended to applicants who can demonstrate direct lineal descent
from a qualifying ancestor through a documented parent-child lineage. Proof is
established through primary and secondary sources including census records, land
transactions, probate files, vital records, and other contemporaneous
documentation.

## William Ray (1790-1843)

I am a member _jure_ through [William Ray
(1790–1843)](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ray-3368), who resided in Jackson
County, Ohio, by 1830. His presence in the county is confirmed by the 1830
federal census, placing him among the early settlers of the region during its
initial period of organized settlement

William Ray's life reflects the broader pattern of westward migration from North
Carolina into Ohio in the early nineteenth century. He later died in 1843,
leaving a documentary footprint that includes census, probate, and land records
sufficient to establish both residence and continuity of family settlement. In
addition to his civilian life, William Ray served in the Ohio Militia during the
War of 1812, [a fact documented independently and submitted separately to the
General Society of the War of
1812](/ancestry/general-society-of-the-war-of-1812). While military service is
not a qualification requirement for First Families of Jackson County, it
provides additional historical context for his residence and civic participation
in Ohio during the early national period.

Membership in the First Families of Jackson County honors the men and women who
established permanent communities in southern Ohio and contributed to the
county's early development. It also reflects a commitment to preserving the
historical record through accurate documentation, transparent sourcing, and
respect for archival standards, ensuring that early family histories are
recorded with clarity and care for future scholarship.
