The [Order of Americans of Armorial Ancestry](https://www.armorialorg.com/)
is a hereditary society that recognizes and honors the descendants of
individuals who bore a coat of arms and who settled in what is now the United
States prior to 1783. The Order was organized on September 15, 1903, and
incorporated in New York State later that year. Founded by Mrs. William Gerry
Slade and a group of genealogists and heraldry enthusiasts, the society was
established to preserve the memory of early American settlers who were
armigerous under the heraldic laws of European sovereigns.

Membership is open to individuals who can demonstrate lineal descent from an
ancestor who bore arms granted, recorded, or recognized by an authorized
heraldic body, such as the [College of
Arms](https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/) in London, the [Lord Lyon King of
Arms](https://courtofthelordlyon.scot/) in Edinburgh, or other similar
institutions, and who immigrated to colonial America before the close of the
Revolutionary War. The Order promotes historical research and education in
heraldry and genealogy, helping to illuminate the symbolic legacy of armorial
bearings within American family history.

This focus on armigerous ancestry is not symbolic; it helps illuminate the
social fabric of the colonial period. Armorial bearings were often associated
with land ownership, legal standing, professional rank, or civic responsibility,
attributes that many early immigrants brought with them or sought to establish
anew in the American colonies. Recognizing these individuals through their coats
of arms underscores the complex identities they carried across the Atlantic: as
subjects of European crowns, as participants in emerging colonial societies, and
as progenitors of American families whose stories are often told through both
documentary and visual heritage.

Heraldry, in this sense, is more than ornamental. It is a structured language
that offers insight into values, alliances, professions, and aspirations. By
documenting and preserving the heraldic claims of early settlers, the Order
contributes to a more nuanced understanding of colonial American identity, one
that includes not just when and where a person arrived, but what traditions and
institutions they represented, and how they expressed continuity with the
cultural and legal frameworks of the Old World while adapting to the challenges
of the New.

##  John Hoar, Esquire, of Massachusetts

My membership in the Order of Americans of Armorial Ancestry is _jure sanguinis_
through [John Hoar, Esquire, of Massachusetts](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoar-9), a
17th-century lawyer, negotiator, and colonial figure of note.  The arms
attributed to John Hoar are:

> Sable, a double-headed eagle displayed within a bordure engrailed Argent.
> Crest--An eagle's head erased Sable, gorged with a bar gemelle Or.  Motto--_In
> ardua_.

These arms, confirmed in multiple American heraldic sources and consistent with
colonial-era usage, are striking not only in their symbolism but in their
alignment with other prominent Hoare families in the British Isles. The same
basic arms, black field, silver double-headed eagle, engrailed silver border,
were borne by several noble and armigerous lines of the Hoare name across
England and Ireland.

Most notably, these arms were used by the Hoare baronets of Barn Elms, a title
created in 1786 for Richard Hoare, a descendant of Sir Richard Hoare
(1648–1719), Lord Mayor of London and founder of the private bank [C. Hoare &
Co](https://www.hoaresbank.co.uk/).  [According to _Burke's
Peerage_](https://archive.org/details/generalarmoryofe00burk/page/494/mode/1up),
their arms were:

> Sable, an eagle displayed with two heads Argent, charged on the breast with an
> ermine spot, within a bordure engrailed of the second.

The only difference from John Hoar's version is the ermine spot on the eagle's
breast, which was almost certainly a mark of differencing, rather than a formal
augmentation. In English heraldry, it was, and remains, common for junior or
collateral branches of a family to use the same core arms with slight
modifications to distinguish lineages. The structure and symbolism of the arms
remain otherwise identical, signaling a strong connection across branches of the
Hoare family.

The same arms as John Hoar also appear in the Hoare baronetcy of Annabella, in
the County of Cork. That title, in the Baronetage of Ireland, was created in
1784 for [Joseph
Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Joseph_Hoare,_1st_Baronet), an Irish MP
who notably opposed the [Act of Union in
1800](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/parliamentandireland/collections/ireland/act-of-union-1800/)
at over 90 years old. His descendants likewise bore the same coat, further
affirming its use across multiple branches of the Hoare name, spanning both
England and Ireland. While direct lineage among these branches has not been
conclusively documented, the continuity of arms is unmistakable.

A more elaborated variation appears with the Hoare baronets of Sidestrand Hall,
later elevated to the peerage as Viscount Templewood in 1944. Their arms differ,
but maintain the same core motif:

> Sable, an eagle displayed with two heads between three crosses couped within a
> bordure indented all Argent.

This version, used by Sir Samuel Hoare, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary in
the 20th century, reflects a later heraldic development incorporating cadency
and personal distinction. Nonetheless, the double-headed eagle remains central
to identity across centuries of political, financial, and colonial activity by
families of the same name.  While no documentary evidence yet links John Hoar
directly to a specific English branch, the heraldic connection is strong. It
suggests either a cadet line of the same stock or a collateral relation with
enduring rights to the family arms prior to later differencing.

## Henry Adams of Massachusetts

My supplemental membership in the Order of Americans of Armorial Ancestry is
*jure sanguinis* through [Henry Adams of
Massachusetts](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Adams-277), the immigrant progenitor
of the Adams family of Braintree and the forebear of two American presidents.
Born in Somersetshire, England, around 1583, [Henry Adams immigrated to the
Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638](/ancestry/ofpa), settling first at Mount
Wollaston, later known as Braintree (now Quincy). His arrival came amid the
Great Migration, when thousands of English Puritans sought religious freedom and
opportunity in New England.

The arms attributed to Henry Adams are those borne by his English ancestors of
Devonshire, as recorded in *Burke's General Armory* and several colonial-era
sources:

{% include figure.html
image="ancestry/oaaa/adams-arms-full.svg"

cap="Arms of Henry Adams of Massachusetts"
alt="Arms of Henry Adams of Massachusetts" %}

> Or, on a cross Gules, five mullets Argent.  Crest--Out of a ducal coronet Or,
> a lion affrontee Gules.

These arms were used by multiple Adams families in Somerset and Devon and are
found in heraldic records dating to the Tudor period. Their later use in
Massachusetts reflects both the persistence of English heraldic identity and the
continuing social recognition of arms among early New England settlers. The
symbolism of the cross and mullets aligns with traditional Christian and martial
themes, often associated with steadfastness, honor, and service.

Henry Adams received a grant of land at Mount Wollaston from the town of
Braintree in 1639, where he established himself as a farmer and patriarch of a
large family. His death in 1646 is commemorated by a memorial in Quincy,
erected in 1823 by his descendants, which records his emigration and influence
on the early colony. Among his eight sons were Joseph Adams, ancestor of
President John Adams and President John Quincy Adams, and Samuel Adams, ancestor
of the patriot and signer of the Articles of Confederation bearing the same
name.

No contemporary motto is known to have been borne by Henry Adams or his English
forebears of Somerset and Devon. Neither Burke's General Armory nor Fairbairn's
Crests associates one with the arms "Or, on a cross Gules, five mullets Argent."
The 1823 Quincy monument erected by his descendants likewise records no heraldic
motto. Later generations of the Adams family adopted personal mottoes reflecting
Enlightenment and republican ideals, most notably "Libertatem amicitiam
retinebis et fidem" ("You will preserve liberty, friendship, and faith") used by
President John Adams, and "Alteri seculo" ("For another age") employed by John
Quincy Adams. These later mottoes, however, were individual adoptions and not
inherited from the immigrant ancestor.

While no formal record survives of Henry Adams's arms being regranted or
confirmed in the colonies, their attribution is consistent across several
authoritative heraldic references and adopted by his descendants in later
American usage. The enduring association of these arms with the Adams family
underscores the family's continuing recognition of its English roots and its
place within the broader narrative of armigerous colonial ancestry.


## John Bigelow of Massachusetts

My supplemental membership in the Order of Americans of Armorial Ancestry is
_jure sanguinis_ through [John Bigelow of Watertown,
Massachusetts](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bigelow-24), who arrived in New
England about 1637 and became one of the early settlers of that town. He was a
[skilled blacksmith](/ancestry/gcat) and civic figure who helped establish the
social and economic foundations of Watertown during the first generation of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony. His descendants became numerous throughout New
England, producing several notable public servants and intellectuals in later
centuries.

The arms attributed to John Bigelow are recorded in several American armorial
compilations of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries:

{% include figure.html

cap="Arms of John Bigelow of Massachusetts"
alt="Arms of John Bigelow of Massachusetts" %}

> Or, three lozenges Azure. Crest--A ram's head erased Azure, charged
> with three lozenges, attired Or.

These arms, simple and striking, follow a classic English pattern of
geometric ordinaries on a plain field. TThe arrangement of three
lozenges is a recurrent medieval motif. [Victorian handbooks commonly
gloss the
lozenge](https://archive.org/details/symbolismsofhera00wadeuoft/symbolismsofhera00wadeuoft/page/94/mode/2up)
as signifying honesty and constancy, though [more modern
authorities](https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxdrich/page/4/mode/2up)
caution that such fixed meanings are late and not intrinsic to medieval
practice. The tinctures, Or and Azure, are a conventional pairing
representing generosity and loyalty. While the blazon does not specify
disposition, heraldic precedent supports either a 2-and-1 or in-fess
arrangement, both of which are acceptable in American usage.

The crest, a ram's head erased Azure charged with three lozenges Or and
attired Or, provides a heraldic echo of the shield through the
repetition of the lozenge motif. The ram, a traditional emblem of
strength and perseverance, reinforces themes of fortitude and creative
energy, qualities that harmonize with both the artisan background of the
immigrant ancestor and the broader moral associations of the name. The
erased form, showing the rough line of separation, is characteristic of
seventeenth-century armorial style, and the limited palette of gold and
blue preserves both simplicity and elegance.


The Bigelow blazon above is the form printed in Crozier's _General
Armory_ (1904) and repeated in Matthews's _American Armoury and Blue
Book_ (1907). These two compilers remain the principal authorities for
colonial American attributions and make no mention of a motto. Later
family-society versions, especially those published by the Bigelow
Family Association, introduce a variant field Argent and the Latin motto
_Finis coronat opus_ ("The end crowns the work"), neither of which is
attested in the early American armorials. While no specific English
visitation record has been located under the name Bigelow, the
lozenge-based pattern is consistent with medieval English heraldic usage
and fits comfortably within established stylistic traditions.


## Isaac Stearns of Massachusetts

My supplemental membership in the Order of Americans of Armorial Ancestry is
_jure sanguinis_ through [Isaac Stearns of Watertown,
Massachusetts](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Stearns-36), who arrived in New
England in 1630 with the [Winthrop
fleet](https://archive.org/details/winthropfleetof100bank/) and settled at
Watertown soon after.  A freeman by the early 1630s, he worked his land and
participated in the civic life of the new town, and his line became one of the
early New England kin networks.

cap="Arms of Isaac Stearns of Massachusetts"
alt="Arms of Isaac Stearns of Massachusetts" %}

> Or, a chevron between three crosses flory pierced Sable.  Crest--A falcon
rising proper.

This is a compact, high-contrast design in the classic metal-and-color pairing
of Or and Sable. The chevron anchors the composition against the gold field,
while the three crosses flory pierced add a late-medieval flavor. A cross flory
terminates in trefoiled tips; pierced indicates a round void at the center of
each cross. Emphasizing the piercings in the artwork prevents the black charges
from reading too heavy and preserves the intended lightness of the design.
American sources give the blazon in this concise form; in practice, renderers
usually match the chevron to the crosses in Sable to keep the palette economical
and coherent.

The crest, a falcon rising proper, invites a naturalistic treatment: the bird
rising with wings partially elevated and addorsed, head to dexter, legs braced
as if about to take flight. Proper allows natural falcon coloration, so the
crest’s restrained browns and grays contrast with the stark geometry of the
shield while remaining within period norms. 

The Stearns blazon above is the form printed by the early American compilers
commonly cited for colonial attributions. English visitation entries under
Stearns/Stearn/Stearne/Sterne do not readily show this exact cross flory pierced
configuration, which explains why American references are the standard citations
for OAAA purposes. No contemporary motto is recorded for Isaac Stearns in the
early American armorials.


## William Learned of Massachusetts

My supplemental membership in the Order of Americans of Armorial
Ancestry is _jure sanguinis_ through [William Learned of Charlestown,
Massachusetts](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Learned-2), who arrived in
New England by 1632 and was among the earliest settlers of that town.
Born in England around the end of the sixteenth century, he joined the
Puritan migration and became an active participant in the civic and
religious life of early Charlestown and later Woburn. His descendants
were numerous and distinguished, producing clergy, scholars, and public
officials throughout New England's colonial and early republican
periods.

{% include figure.html
image="ancestry/oaaa/learned-arms-full.svg"
placement="right" width="4"
cap="Arms of William Learned of Massachusetts"
alt="Arms of William Learned of Massachusetts" %}

The arms attributed to William Learned are recorded in several American
heraldic compilations:

> Azure, a saltire engrailed Or, between four lozenges Argent.  Crest--A
> griffin rampant.

This is a well-constructed composition in the classic late-medieval
style, dominated by the saltire engrailed, a form that combines strength
of line with ornamental grace. The Azure field paired with an Or saltire
produces one of heraldry's most enduring color pairings—blue and gold
for loyalty and generosity, while the four lozenges Argent provide
balance and lightness against the darker field. Together, the charges
create a clean, geometric harmony typical of the early Stuart period.

The griffin rampant crest introduces a dynamic and martial element. As a
hybrid of lion and eagle, the griffin has represented vigilance,
courage, and wisdom since classical antiquity. Its use here, rendered
Azure, beaked and armed Or to harmonize with the shield, reinforces
those ideals while visually uniting the blue-and-gold palette across
both field and crest. In period practice, the absence of a recorded
tincture would have permitted this kind of harmonious coloring, and it
reflects good heraldic economy. The overall effect is disciplined yet
spirited.

The Learned blazon and crest appear in Crozier and Matthews without
tinctures for the crest or any accompanying motto. No corresponding
entry has been identified in the English visitations or in Burke's
_General Armory_, suggesting that the arms were either assumed in the
colonies or derived from an unrecorded English source. The composition
fits comfortably within the broader English
"saltire-plus-quarter-charges" pattern found in contemporary arms such
as those of Christie of Riddry or other families employing engrailed
saltires. The arrangement of the four lozenges, one in each quarter, is
both heraldically orthodox and visually balanced.

## Jonathan Fairbanks of Massachusetts

My fifth supplemental membership in the Order of Americans of Armorial Ancestry
is _jure sanguinis_ through [Jonathan Fairbanks of Dedham,
Massachusetts](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Fayrbanke-1), who immigrated to New
England in 1633 and became one of the founding settlers of Dedham. Born in
England in 1594, he established himself as a substantial yeoman and civic
participant in the early Massachusetts Bay Colony. His family remained prominent
in New England for generations, and the Fairbanks House in Dedham, built by his
son in 1637, is widely recognized as the oldest surviving timber-frame house in
North America.

{% include figure.html
image="ancestry/oaaa/fairbanks-arms-full.svg"
placement="right" width="4"
cap="Arms of Jonathan Fairbanks of Massachusetts"
alt="Arms of Jonathan Fairbanks of Massachusetts" %}

The arms attributed to Jonathan Fairbanks are consistently recorded in early
American heraldic compilations and family armorial traditions:

> Argent, on a fess Azure, between three hurts, a bezant. Crest--Three arrows
> tied together, one in pale and two in saltire, points downward.

This is a restrained and distinctly English design, relying on simple geometric
charges rather than overtly martial figures. The fess, one of heraldry's
principal ordinaries, provides structural clarity and visual balance across the
shield. The hurts, blue roundels, supply contrast against the silver field,
while the bezant placed upon the fess introduces a single metallic accent. The
limited palette of Argent, Azure, and Or produces a disciplined and harmonious
composition typical of early modern English armory.

The crest, three arrows bound together with their points downward, is
particularly expressive. In heraldic tradition, a bundle of arrows signifies
unity, concord, and collective strength, conveying the idea that what is fragile
alone becomes strong when bound together. The arrangement—one in pale and two in
saltire—is formally precise and visually stable, while the downward orientation
of the points tempers any overtly aggressive interpretation. The crest reads
less as a symbol of warfare than of cohesion, resolve, and mutual obligation,
values well suited to a founding family in a covenant-based Puritan community.
Contemporary sources do not specify tinctures for the crest; in modern
renderings, I have therefore chosen to depict the arrows proper, bound with a
ribbon Or, as a harmonizing and visually restrained solution consistent with
period practice.

Unlike many colonial attributions that show wide variation, the Fairbanks arms
appear with notable consistency across American sources, including Crozier and
Matthews. The combination of a fess with subsidiary roundels is well attested in
English heraldry, and the distinctive arrow-bundle crest further differentiates
the Fairbanks arms from more common lion or bird crests. While a definitive
English visitation entry has not been conclusively identified, the stability of
both shield and crest across early American references supports their
recognition as the established arms of the Fairbanks line in New England.

The Fairbanks arms are traditionally associated with the Latin motto _Finem
respice_, meaning "Consider the end." The phrase reflects a moral emphasis on
foresight, consequence, and prudence, themes that align closely with both
Puritan thought and the symbolic unity expressed by the crest. While the precise
moment of the motto's adoption cannot be documented with certainty, its
long-standing association with the Fairbanks arms in American usage is well
established.
