The [Order of Americans of Armorial Ancestry](https://www.armorialancestry.org/)
is a hereditary society that recognizes and honors the descendants of
individuals who bore a coat of arms and who settled in what is now the United
States prior to 1783. The Order was organized on September 15, 1903, and
incorporated in New York State later that year. Founded by Mrs. William Gerry
Slade and a group of genealogists and heraldry enthusiasts, the society was
established to preserve the memory of early American settlers who were
armigerous under the heraldic laws of European sovereigns.

Membership is open to individuals who can demonstrate lineal descent from an
ancestor who bore arms granted, recorded, or recognized by an authorized
heraldic body, such as the [College of
Arms](https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/) in London, the [Lord Lyon King of
Arms](https://courtofthelordlyon.scot/) in Edinburgh, or other similar
institutions, and who immigrated to colonial America before the close of the
Revolutionary War. The Order promotes historical research and education in
heraldry and genealogy, helping to illuminate the symbolic legacy of armorial
bearings within American family history.

This focus on armigerous ancestry is not symbolic; it helps illuminate the
social fabric of the colonial period. Armorial bearings were often associated
with land ownership, legal standing, professional rank, or civic responsibility,
attributes that many early immigrants brought with them or sought to establish
anew in the American colonies. Recognizing these individuals through their coats
of arms underscores the complex identities they carried across the Atlantic: as
subjects of European crowns, as participants in emerging colonial societies, and
as progenitors of American families whose stories are often told through both
documentary and visual heritage.

Heraldry, in this sense, is more than ornamental. It is a structured language
that offers insight into values, alliances, professions, and aspirations. By
documenting and preserving the heraldic claims of early settlers, the Order
contributes to a more nuanced understanding of colonial American identity, one
that includes not just when and where a person arrived, but what traditions and
institutions they represented, and how they expressed continuity with the
cultural and legal frameworks of the Old World while adapting to the challenges
of the New.

##  John Hoar, Esquire, of Massachusetts

My membership in the Order of Americans of Armorial Ancestry is _jure sanguinis_
through [John Hoar, Esquire, of Massachusetts](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoar-9), a
17th-century lawyer, negotiator, and colonial figure of note.  The arms
attributed to John Hoar are:

> Sable, a double-headed eagle displayed within a bordure engrailed Argent.
> Crest--An eagle's head erased Sable, gorged with a bar gemelle Or.  Motto--_In
> ardua_.

These arms, confirmed in multiple American heraldic sources and consistent with
colonial-era usage, are striking not only in their symbolism but in their
alignment with other prominent Hoare families in the British Isles. The same
basic arms, black field, silver double-headed eagle, engrailed silver border,
were borne by several noble and armigerous lines of the Hoare name across
England and Ireland.

Most notably, these arms were used by the Hoare baronets of Barn Elms, a title
created in 1786 for Richard Hoare, a descendant of Sir Richard Hoare
(1648â€“1719), Lord Mayor of London and founder of the private bank [C. Hoare &
Co](https://www.hoaresbank.co.uk/).  [According to _Burke's
Peerage_](https://archive.org/details/generalarmoryofe00burk/page/494/mode/1up),
their arms were:

> Sable, an eagle displayed with two heads Argent, charged on the breast with an
> ermine spot, within a bordure engrailed of the second.

The only difference from John Hoar's version is the ermine spot on the eagle's
breast, which was almost certainly a mark of differencing, rather than a formal
augmentation. In English heraldry, it was, and remains, common for junior or
collateral branches of a family to use the same core arms with slight
modifications to distinguish lineages. The structure and symbolism of the arms
remain otherwise identical, signaling a strong connection across branches of the
Hoare family.

The same arms as John Hoar also appear in the Hoare baronetcy of Annabella, in
the County of Cork. That title, in the Baronetage of Ireland, was created in
1784 for [Joseph
Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Joseph_Hoare,_1st_Baronet), an Irish MP
who notably opposed the [Act of Union in
1800](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/parliamentandireland/collections/ireland/act-of-union-1800/)
at over 90 years old. His descendants likewise bore the same coat, further
affirming its use across multiple branches of the Hoare name, spanning both
England and Ireland. While direct lineage among these branches has not been
conclusively documented, the continuity of arms is unmistakable.

A more elaborated variation appears with the Hoare baronets of Sidestrand Hall,
later elevated to the peerage as Viscount Templewood in 1944. Their arms differ,
but maintain the same core motif:

> Sable, an eagle displayed with two heads between three crosses couped within a
> bordure indented all Argent.

This version, used by Sir Samuel Hoare, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary in
the 20th century, reflects a later heraldic development incorporating cadency
and personal distinction. Nonetheless, the double-headed eagle remains central
to identity across centuries of political, financial, and colonial activity by
families of the same name.  While no documentary evidence yet links John Hoar
directly to a specific English branch, the heraldic connection is strong. It
suggests either a cadet line of the same stock or a collateral relation with
enduring rights to the family arms prior to later differencing.

*Additional memberships will be added as they are approved.*
