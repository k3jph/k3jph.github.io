The [First Families of Miami
County](https://sites.rootsweb.com/~ohmchgs/mchgs_recognition.html)
lineage society is dedicated to recognizing the descendants of
individuals who resided in Miami County, Ohio, prior to 1831.

## Henry Cavender

[Henry Cavender](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cavender-247), born in
1825 in Staunton Township, Miami County, Ohio, qualifies for membership
in this society.  As a resident of the county before 1831, Henry
represents a significant part of the early settlement history of the
region.

Henry's life in Miami County is documented in his death certificate,
which verifies his birth date and location. This membership acknowledges
the contributions of early settlers like Henry and helps preserve the
genealogical and historical records of the county.
