The [Order of Founders of the Granville
District](https://orderoffoundersofthegranvilledistrict.weebly.com/) is
a hereditary society dedicated to honoring descendants of individuals
who resided in the Granville District of North Carolina between 1663
and 1763. This lineage society celebrates the historical significance of
the district and its settlers, who played a key role in the colonial
development of the region.

The society fosters the preservation of historical records and promotes
the study of the Granville District, its governance, and its impact on
early American history. Members collaborate to ensure that the legacy of
this unique area, governed semi-independently by John Earl Granville,
remains a recognized part of North Carolina's heritage.

## Moses Teague

[Moses Teague](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Teague-228) was a prominent
landowner and settler in Rowan County, North Carolina, during the
colonial period. He played a significant role in the development of the
Granville District, acquiring over 1,800 acres through land grants
issued in the mid-18th century.  These grants, concentrated along
[Abbott's
Creek](https://piedmonttrails.com/2017/11/19/historical-treasure-of-abbotts-creek/),
positioned Moses as a key figure in the settlement and agricultural
expansion of the region.

### Early Life and Family Background

Moses was the [grandson of Edward Teague](/ancestry/offm), an early
Maryland settler who arrived in the Province of Maryland in 1675 as part
of the headright system. Edward's life as a frontier landowner in Cecil
County laid the foundation for the Teague family's westward migration,
with Moses representing the third generation of Teagues to pursue
opportunities in new territories.

Moses was born on March 3, 1718, in Cecil County, Maryland, and
likely grew up in an environment shaped by farming, land speculation,
and migration. By the mid-18th century, Moses had moved southward,
eventually settling in Rowan County, North Carolina, where he
established himself as a major landholder.

### Landholdings and Contributions

Between 1756 and 1759, Moses Teague acquired at least four documented
land grants in the Granville District, totaling over 1,800 acres.  These
grants included significant tracts along Abbott's Creek, a key waterway
in the region. The clustering of four grants within a few weeks in early
1759 suggests deliberate planning to consolidate contiguous parcels,
creating a unified estate suitable for farming and resource management.

#### Granville Land Grants:
1. 1756-11-05: 350 acres
2. 1759-02-22: 636 acres
4. 1759-03-01: 437 acres

### Family and Legacy

Moses married [Elizabeth
Loftin](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Loftin-83) around 1738, with whom
he had several children, including [David
Teague](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Teague-263), who inherited Moses's
homestead.  After Elizabeth's death, Moses married [Rachael
Taylor](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Taylor-4754), who is prominently
mentioned in his will as the primary beneficiary during her lifetime.
Moses and Elizabeth's daughter, [Charity
Teague](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Teague-265) married [Thomas
Ray](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ray-654) and was mother to [William
Ray](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ray-3368), soldier in the [War of
1812](/ancestry/gsw1812).

Moses's will, written in **1786** and proved in **1799**, provides
detailed insight into his wealth, priorities, and family dynamics. It
included land, livestock, household goods, and an enslaved man named
Abraham, reflecting Moses's status as a man of means during his time.

### Enslavement and Moral Contradictions

While Moses Teague's legacy includes his contributions to settlement and
agriculture, it also reflects the moral contradictions of his era. Moses
enslaved at least one individual, Abraham, whom he bequeathed first to
his wife Rachael and later to his son David. This practice stands in
tension with his family's Quaker connections, as many Quakers in the
region were beginning to oppose slavery by the late 18th century.
Moses's life illustrates the complexities of colonial landownership and
the economic realities of the period.

### Connection to Edward Teague and William Ray

Moses Teague represents a critical link in the Teague family's lineage,
bridging his grandfather Edward's pioneering settlement in Maryland and
his grandson William Ray's military servsice in the War of 1812. This
multi-generational narrative highlights the family's adaptability and
contributions to early American society.

### Moses Teague's Legacy

Moses Teague's story is one of ambition, opportunity, and complexity.
His substantial landholdings and role in settling the Granville District
underscore his influence in colonial North Carolina, while his family's
continued prominence reflects the enduring impact of his life's work.

## Membership in the Order

Through my descent from Moses Teague, I am honored to celebrate his
contributions to the settlement of the Granville District and his

Founders of the Granville District underscores the importance of
preserving this unique chapter of colonial America.
