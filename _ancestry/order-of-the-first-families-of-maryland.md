The [Order of the First Families of
Maryland](https://firstfamiliesofmaryland.com/) is an hereditary society
dedicated to honoring the descendants of the early settlers who played a role in
the founding and development of the [Province of
Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Maryland).  Established to
recognize those who can trace their lineage back to individuals who arrived in
Maryland between 1634 and 1734, the society emphasizes the preservation of the
state’s colonial history and heritage. Members work to promote historical
scholarship and public awareness of Maryland's early colonial period, as well as
contribute to the conservation of historical sites and documents related to this
formative era in American history.

## Edward Teague

[Edward Teague](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Teague-9) was a Maryland
colonist and an early settler of Cecil County, Maryland, known for his
landholdings at *Pembroke* and *Tegg's Delight* along the Susquehanna
River. His life and legacy are traced through genealogical records, his
land patents, and the migration of his descendants, notably into North
Carolina. His arrival in Maryland in 1675 places him among the first
wave of immigrants into the expanding southern colonies.

### Early Life and Arrival in Maryland

Edward Teague is believed to have been born around 1660, though his
precise birthplace and parentage remain uncertain. A common theory
posits his birth in Bristol, England, due to the association with Thomas
Jones, a mariner from that city, who transported Edward into the
Province of Maryland in 1675. However, no direct evidence links Edward
to any specific family or location in England. His appearance in
Maryland court records in 1674 provides the earliest documented mention
of him:

> Thomas Jones brings his servant Edward Teage before the Court and
> prays the worshipful Court to judge his age. He, ye said Edward
> Teague, coming into this province without indentures. After a full
> review by the Justices setting in Court of the said servant Edward
> Teage, this Court does adjudge him the said Edward Teage fourteen
> years of age.

At this time, Edward was deemed to be about fourteen years old. His
arrival in Maryland was part of the broader headright system that
allowed individuals, like Thomas Jones, to receive land in exchange for
transporting settlers to the colony. Jones later claimed a headright of
250 acres for transporting himself, Edward, and three others to
Maryland.

### Land Grants and Settling in Cecil County

Edward Teague's life in Maryland was marked by his acquisition of
significant land in Cecil County. By the mid-1690s, he had secured two
notable land patents: [*Pembroke* (160 acres) and *Tegg's Delight* (130
acres)](https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagserm/sm1/sm2/000000/000043/pdf/mdsa_sm2_43.pdf?page=256).
Both tracts were located along the Susquehanna River, then a frontier
region.

On October 10, 1695, the patent for *Pembroke* was officially granted to
Edward:

> Charles, absolute Lord and Proprietary of Maryland, to all persons...
> grant unto him the said Edward Tegg all that tract or parcel of land
> called *Pembroke* lying in Cecil County and on the east side of the
> Susquehanna River, containing 160 acres... to be held of us and our
> heirs in free and common soccage by fealty only...

The following month, on November 10, 1695, *Tegg's Delight* was
patented:

> We do hereby grant unto him, the said Edward Tegg, all that tract or
> parcel of land called *Tegg's Delight* lying in Cecil County on the
> east side of Susquehanna River...

These land patents solidified Edward's standing as a landowner and
frontiersman in early Maryland, providing the foundation for his
descendants to build upon.

### Life and Challenges in the New World

Edward's life, like many settlers of the time, was not without
challenges. In January 1687, a warrant was issued for his arrest over an
unpaid debt:

> Entries returnable the Second Tuesday in Janry: Anno Dom 1687. n:est:
> Invts Caps agt Edward Teague to answer to Thomas Roberts of a plea of
> Debt John Robinson Subpd on; the part of y plte.

The sheriff was unable to locate Edward to answer the plea, but the
record suggests financial struggles that were not uncommon for settlers
trying to establish themselves in the New World. Edward was likely
balancing the demands of managing land, dealing with the colonial
economy, and surviving on the frontier.

By 1695, Edward had overcome these challenges, having secured land
patents and established himself as a landowner. The inventory of his
estate upon his death in 1697 lists practical items, including tools for
farming and maintaining a homestead, as well as personal effects like a
feather bed, chests, and brandy. Tobacco was listed among his
possessions, indicating that Edward participated in Maryland's cash-crop
economy.

### Family Life

Edward Teague married [Susannah
Welch](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Welch-72), and together they had at
least three children: [William](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Teague-8),
Catherine, and Anne.  William, born around 1695, would eventually
migrate to North Carolina, continuing the family's westward expansion
that characterized many colonial families. This migration pattern aligns
with the larger trend of frontier families seeking new opportunities in
less populated regions of the colonies.

After Edward's death in 1697, Susannah remarried Emanuel Smith, who
became the administrator of Edward's estate. Edward's estate was finally
settled in 1702, reflecting the often complex process of probate in
colonial Maryland, particularly on the frontier.

### Tragic Death and Unrecovered Body

Edward Teague's life ended tragically in 1697. He is believed to have
drowned in the Susquehanna River, near his property. Local records
indicate that his body was never recovered, adding an air of mystery to
his death:

> Edward Teague died in the River that runs through Tegg's Delight.
> According to the [Cecil County Historical Society](), his body was never
> recovered.

The lack of documentation regarding his burial further complicates the
narrative, with no known grave site. Edward's widow and children
continued on, with Susannah managing his estate until her remarriage.

### Legacy and Migration of Descendants

Edward Teague's descendants continued to play significant roles in
American history. His son William Teague migrated to North Carolina,
establishing the family in a region that would later become important
during the American Revolution. William's son, [Moses
Teague](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Teague-228), fought as a patriot
during the war, further cementing the family's place in early American
history. Moses's grandson, [William
Ray](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ray-3368), carried on the family's
military tradition, serving in the Ohio Militia during the War of 1812.

The land that Edward once called home remains a physical testament to
his legacy. Today, Tegg's Delight and Pembroke are part of [Camp
Conowingo](https://www.gscm.org/en/members/for-girl-scouts/camp-and-outdoors/camp-conowingo.html),
a Girl Scouts camp in Maryland. Though much has changed, traces of
Edward's original homestead still stand, a silent witness to the life of
a man who helped settle Maryland's frontier.

Edward Teague's story, while pieced together from fragments of history,
remains a testament to the resilience of early settlers. From his
arrival in Maryland as a teenage servant to his establishment as a
landowner and patriarch of a prominent family line, Edward's life is a
microcosm of the colonial experience, filled with struggle, survival,
and the pursuit of opportunity in the New World.
