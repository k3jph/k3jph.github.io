The [First Families of
Ohio](https://www.ogs.org/lineage-societies/first-families-of-ohio/) is
a lineage society of the Ohio Genealogical Society, honoring descendants
of pioneers who settled in Ohio by the end of 1820. This prestigious
society recognizes the significant contributions of these early settlers
in shaping Ohio's history and preserving their legacy for future
generations.

## Barzilla Bunnell and Sophia Baumgardener

[Barzilla Bunnell](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bunnell-713) was born
on April 9, 1807, in Ross County, Ohio, and [Sophia
Baumgardener](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Baumgardener-12) was born on
August 28, 1810, in Warren County, Ohio.  They married on August 16,
1832, and began their life together in Ohio, where Barzilla worked as a
farmer. Their early years in Ohio are emblematic of the pioneering
spirit that defined the state’s early settlers.

### Contributions and Legacy

Barzilla and Sophia raised a family and contributed to the growth of
their community through their dedication to agriculture. In the mid-19th
century, they relocated to White County, Indiana, where they continued
their farming pursuits. Barzilla’s work ethic and Sophia’s role in
managing their household underscore the resilience and determination of
Ohio’s early settlers.

Sophia passed away on January 23, 1883, and Barzilla followed on
December 29, 1891. Both are buried in the Bunnell Cemetery in Reynolds,
Indiana. Their lives and legacy are honored as part of Ohio's early
settler history, and my membership in First Families of Ohio ensures
their contributions are remembered.

## About First Families of Ohio

Established by the Ohio Genealogical Society, First Families of Ohio is
a lineage society that recognizes descendants of individuals who resided
in the state before 1821. Members must demonstrate direct descent and
provide documented evidence of their ancestors' residency in Ohio during
this period.

Inductees are honored at the annual Ohio Genealogical Society
Conference, where they receive a certificate and a commemorative pin.
Those proving ancestors who lived in Ohio by 1803 also receive the FFO
1803 Bicentennial pin, marking their ties to Ohio’s earliest pioneers.

## Legacy and Membership

Through my membership in First Families of Ohio, I honor the lives of
Barzilla Bunnell and Sophia Baumgardener, whose journey and
contributions reflect the pioneering values of early Ohio settlers.
Their story is a testament to the enduring impact of Ohio’s first
families on the state's history and development.
