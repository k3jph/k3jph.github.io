The [Descendants of Early Postmasters 1607–1900
(DEPM)](https://descendantsofearlypostmasters.weebly.com/) is a
hereditary society that honors individuals whose ancestors contributed
to the growth and operation of the American postal system from the
colonial period through the end of the 19th century. Membership is open
to U.S. citizens of good character, aged 18 or older, who can prove
lineal descent from an ancestor who held a qualifying postal-related
position between 1607 and 1900.

Eligible roles are broadly defined and include not only
[postmasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmaster) and [Postmasters
General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General),
but also [postal
surveyors](https://www.uspis.gov/history-spotlight-2023/first-postal-surveyors),
[inspectors](https://www.uspis.gov/about/history-of-uspis), and clerks.
The society also recognizes tavern keepers and innkeepers who hosted
mail stops, printers,  booksellers who acted as informal distributors,
stagecoach and [Pony Express
riders](https://postalmuseum.si.edu/the-pony-express-delivers),
ferrymen, riverboat and steamship captains, railway mail service
personnel, and even those involved in building roads, bridges, or
clearing waterways to facilitate the delivery of the mail.

The society seeks to deepen the appreciation of American history through
the lens of postal communication and infrastructure. It promotes
scholarship in the field, supports the preservation of postal history,
and encourages [philately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philately)
among its members and the public.  DEPM is proud to support the

[John Hess Adams](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Adams-72496) was a
respected civic leader and skilled tradesman in Reynolds, White County,
Indiana. Born near Norwalk, Ohio, he relocated several times with his
family—first to New York, then back to Ohio, and finally settling in
Indiana by 1845. Over his lifetime, Adams worked as a
[carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry),
[cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_(profession)), farmer, and
railroad foreman. His technical skills and industrious spirit helped lay
the foundation for the small but growing town of Reynolds.

In the 1850s and 1860s, Adams was closely involved with the [New Albany
and Salem Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monon_Railroad), later
known as the Monon Route, serving as a bridge foreman and, later, as the
station agent. This railroad, one of Indiana's most important
19th-century transportation arteries, connected rural towns like
Reynolds to the broader national economy and mail network.

During [President Grover Cleveland’s first
administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/grover-cleveland/)
(1885–1889), Adams was appointed
[postmaster](https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/postmasters.htm)
of Reynolds. In this role, he was responsible for overseeing mail
delivery, maintaining records, and ensuring communication links across
the region—an essential function in an era before telephones were
common. As was typical in small towns at the time, his position often
intersected with other community responsibilities, reinforcing his
status as a trusted public servant.

Adams's service as postmaster placed him within the broader historical
context of American postal expansion during the [Gilded
Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age), a period when rural post
offices became lifelines for commerce, political news, and personal
correspondence. Postmasters were pivotal in sustaining the flow of
information across America's heartland, and Adams was no exception.
He was also active in local politics, aligned with the [Democratic
Party](https://democrats.org/), and held several minor offices in the
gift of the people. He and his wife, [Rebecca Elizabeth
Bunnell](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bunnell-729), raised five
children in Reynolds, where Adams lived until his death in 1910. He is
buried in [Bunnell
Cemetery](https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/84171/bunnell-cemetery)
near the town he helped build.
