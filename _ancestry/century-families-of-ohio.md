The [Century Families of Ohio
(CFO)](https://www.ogs.org/about/lineage/cfo/) is a lineage society
under the [Ohio Genealogical Society (OGS)](https://www.ogs.org/),
dedicated to recognizing the descendants of individuals who lived in
Ohio from 1861 to 100 years before the year of application.  At the time
of this application, that was 1924. Membership in CFO acknowledges the
deep-rooted connection to Ohio's history and heritage. Members provide
documented proof of their ancestors' residency in Ohio during the
specified period, helping to preserve the state's genealogical and
historical records.

## Mina Hall and Charles Franklin Cavender

[Mina Elizabeth Hall](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hall-76727), born on
February 9, 1888, in Paulding County, Ohio, was a teacher and homemaker.
She married [Charles Franklin
Cavender](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cavender-524), born on July 23,
1892, in Newton, Miami County, Ohio, who worked as a farmer. Their lives
reflect the everyday experiences of Ohioans during their time. They were
the parents of [Mary Jane
Cavender](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cavender-523), who later married
[Ralph Everett Rees](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rees-4585),
continuing the family's legacy in Ohio.

Because I was unable to find a birth record for Mina, the first date I
am able to prove she was resident in Ohio is as of December 8, 1915,
when she and Charles received their marriage certificate.

## Legacy

Mina and Charles's connection to Ohio provides a glimpse into the
state's past and the lives of its residents. Their documented lineage,
including their marriage and the birth of their daughter Mary Jane,
establishes the family's eligibility for the Century Families of Ohio.
This membership highlights the continuity of the family's presence in
the region and their contributions to its community.
