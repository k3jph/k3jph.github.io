The [Descendants of American Prisoners of War](https://dapow.weebly.com/)
(DAPOW) is a hereditary society that honors the descendants of Americans who
were captured and held as prisoners of war. The society encourages the
preservation of documentary evidence of captivity, and it promotes public
understanding of an aspect of wartime experience that is often difficult to
reconstruct from standard service records alone.

## War Service of Ralph Everett Rees

Ralph Everett Rees (26 June 1916, Loramie, Shelby County, Ohio – 23 April
2003, Maysville, Kentucky) served in the United States Army during the Second
World War as a paratrooper assigned to a commando-type unit. His service placed
him in the North African theater, where American forces were engaged in
highly mobile operations against Axis troops during 1942–1943.

In the summer of 1943, Rees was reported missing in action following
combat operations in North Africa. Contemporary newspaper accounts indicate that
during these actions he was shot in the leg, after which he was captured
by enemy forces and held as a prisoner of war. Initial War Department
notifications to his family reflected the uncertainty common to such
engagements, with Rees first listed as missing before his status became clear.

Subsequent reporting confirmed that Rees had survived his wounds and captivity.
He was held as a prisoner of war for a period estimated to extend from
approximately mid-July to early September 1943, after which he was
released and transferred to a military hospital following his return to
Allied control. Later newspaper articles reported that he had been located
safely and was no longer listed among missing personnel.

Rees's wartime experience encompasses several of the most difficult aspects of
military service: front-line combat, combat injury, captivity as a prisoner of
war, and recovery following release. His service record reflects the realities
faced by American airborne and commando troops operating in North Africa, where
rapid engagements and shifting lines frequently resulted in wounded soldiers
being captured before evacuation could occur.
