The [National Society of the Sons of the American
Revolution](https://www.sar.org) (SAR) is a hereditary society that honors the
legacy of those who fought or supported the cause of American independence
during the Revolutionary War. Established in 1889, SAR preserves the history and
ideals of the American Revolution through education, historical preservation,
and patriotic engagement. Membership is open to male descendants of individuals
who provided military, civil, or patriotic service to the American cause between
1775 and 1783.

My membership in SAR is based on my descent from Marmaduke Coate, who provided
[patriotic
service](https://www.dar.org/national-society/accepted-revolutionary-war-service)
during the Revolution.  Coate is just one of many qualifying ancestors, and my
membership is based on my mother's membership in the [National Society Daughters
of the American Revolution](https://www.dar.org/) (DAR).  His role in the war
reflects the diverse contributions of everyday citizens in securing American
independence.

Through SAR, I participate in the preservation of Revolutionary War history and
genealogy, ensuring that the sacrifices and achievements of my ancestors are not
forgotten. The society also fosters education about the founding principles of
the United States, promoting civic responsibility and national heritage.

## Marmaduke Coate -- Patriotic Service

[Marmaduke Coate](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Coate-4) was born on June 13,
1738, in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, to [Henry
Coate](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Coate-10) and [Esther
Willson](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Willson-2331). The Coate family were
members of the [Religious Society of Friends]()https://quaker.org/, commonly
known as Quakers, a faith that influenced Marmaduke's life.

In 1764, Marmaduke married [Mary Jane
Coppock](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Coppock-29) in South Carolina. Mary Jane,
born on November 6, 1743, in Bush River, Newberry, South Carolina, was the
daughter of Moses Coppock and Martha Lester. The Coppock family, like the
Coates, were Quakers.

According to family tradition, Mary Jane and her sisters were captured by Native
Americans during her childhood. The duration of their captivity varies among
accounts, ranging from five to sixteen years. Some narratives suggest that her
future husband, Marmaduke, ransomed her in 1764 by trading a horse, saddle, and
bridle for her freedom. However, the accuracy of this story is debated among
historians.

Together, Marmaduke and Mary Jane had several children, including:
- Esther Coate – Married John Pemberton.
- Moses Coate – Contributed to the establishment of Quaker meetings in Ohio.
- Henry Coate – Married Eunice Coppock on December 8, 1830, at the Union
  Monthly Meeting in Ludlow Falls, Miami County, Ohio.
- Samuel, Sarah, James, William, John, and Jesse Coate.

## Revolutionary War and Later Years

Despite the Quakers' pacifist beliefs, Marmaduke provided supplies to the
Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. This act of support is
recognized by the Daughters of the American Revolution, which honors him as a
Patriot Ancestor.

In 1805, Marmaduke and Mary Jane moved to Newton Township, Miami County, Ohio,
where they became early settlers and helped establish a Quaker community. Their
home served as a center for worship and communal gatherings.

Marmaduke Coate passed away on September 25, 1822, in Newton Township, Miami
County, Ohio, at the age of 84. He was laid to rest in the Union-Joint Cemetery
in Ludlow Falls, Newton Township, Miami County, Ohio. Mary Jane preceded him in
death, passing away on July 10, 1809, at the age of 65. She was also buried in
the Union-Joint Cemetery.

Marmaduke, Mary Jane, and Moses Coate were early American Quakers who
contributed to the establishment of Quaker communities in Ohio. Their
descendants continued to play roles in local development, maintaining the
family's presence in the region.
