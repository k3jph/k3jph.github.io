The [First Families of Warren County,
Ohio](https://www.wcgsohio.org/first-families) (FFWC) is a lineage
society under the [Warren County Genealogical
Society](https://www.wcgsohio.org/) (WCGS) that recognizes individuals
who can prove descent from pioneers who settled in Warren County, Ohio,
before January 1, 1821. This society documents the contributions of
these settlers to the development of the county.

## Jonathan Newman

[Jonathan Newman](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Newman-16493) was born on
December 8, 1768, in Guilford County, North Carolina. By 1809, he had
settled in Wayne Township, Warren County, Ohio. He married [Anne
Cloud](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cloud-2029) around April 1, 1797,
in Alamance, North Carolina. Newman is documented as an early resident
of the area, contributing to the establishment of the local community.

## Joseph Cloud

[Joseph Cloud](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cloud-619) was born on
March 1, 1742, in Chester County, Pennsylvania, and migrated to Warren
County, Ohio, by 1809. Cloud was a blacksmith, a trade essential for
frontier settlements. He married [Mary Earl
Underwood](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Underwood-3145) in 1763 in
Orange County, North Carolina. Upon settling in Warren County, his trade
and family presence became part of the county's early development.

## Quaker Influence in Early Ohio Development

Both Jonathan Newman and Joseph Cloud were members of the Religious
Society of Friends, [commonly known as Quakers](/ancestry/nsdeq). Their
migration to Warren County was part of a broader movement of Quakers
seeking religious freedom and opportunities in the early 19th century.
Quakers played a significant role in the development of southwestern
Ohio, including Warren County.

By 1807, [approximately 2,000
Quakers](https://quaker.org/legacy/miami/index_files/settlements.html)
resided in southwestern Ohio.  They established communities that
emphasized education, equality, and anti-slavery principles. In Warren
County, Quaker settlements contributed to the region's social and
economic development. Their commitment to pacifism and community
building influenced local customs and governance.

The town of Springboro, [founded in 1815 by Quaker Jonathan
Wright](https://www.springborohistory.org/Springboro/Beginnings.html),
is an example of Quaker influence in the area. Quaker meeting houses and
schools served as centers for social and educational activities,
fostering a sense of community among settlers.

## About First Families of Warren County, Ohio

## Legacy

My membership in the First Families of Warren County, Ohio, recognizes
Jonathan Newman and Joseph Cloud as early settlers of Warren County.

who contributed to the county's early history.
