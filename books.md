The landscape of higher education has been significantly transformed
by the advent of online learning, positioning it as a pivotal element
of academic offerings in the United States and globally. The
flexibility of pursuing entire degree programs or individual courses
online caters to a wide array of student needs and schedules, marking
a shift towards more accessible and adaptable education models.
Furthermore, the integration of online resources into traditional
classroom settings has become a common practice among educators,
aiming to enhance the learning experience through supplemental
materials or innovative approaches like the flipped classroom model.
This method reallocates direct instruction to the digital space,
allowing for more interactive, hands-on learning during physical
class sessions.

However, the transition to online education brings forth a set of
challenges, particularly in the realms of student assessment and
engagement. These challenges are notably pronounced in the fields
of mathematics and statistics, where instructors face the added
task of addressing math anxiety, navigating the abstract nature of
the subjects, and deciphering complex notations in a virtual
environment. This book endeavors to tackle these hurdles head-on,
offering a comprehensive guide to navigating the intricacies of
online mathematics and statistics education. Through a detailed
exploration of innovative teaching methodologies, engagement
strategies, and assessment techniques, we provide educators with
the tools needed to foster meaningful learning experiences for their
students in the digital age.

Accompanying me in this endeavor is [John F.
Beyers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-beyers-ph-d-8948a59/), a
respected authority in online mathematics and statistics education,
currently serving as the program chair at the [University of Maryland
Global Campus](http://www.umuc.edu/). Together, we aim to bridge
the gap between traditional and online education modalities,
presenting practical solutions and insights drawn from our extensive
experience in the field. This book is an invaluable resource for
educators seeking to adapt to the evolving landscape of higher
education, ensuring that students not only learn effectively but
also develop a lasting appreciation for the mathematical sciences.

## Handbook of Military and Defense Operations Research

Operations Research (OR) stands as a foundational pillar in the
sphere of military and defense management, marking its significance
since its strategic deployment during World War II. Initially, OR
played a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency of supply chains,
advancing strategic simulation, and fostering superior management
strategies for the Allied forces. The advent of OR during this
period was instrumental in leveraging analytical rigor to achieve
operational excellence and strategic advantages.

Since its inception, the domain of Operations Research has witnessed
exponential growth, branching into a myriad of applications that
transcend the confines of military strategy. Today, OR's influence
permeates through the realms of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity,
and big data analytics, establishing itself as an integral component
of management science across diverse industries including manufacturing,
advertising, telecommunications, and beyond.

The _Handbook of Military and Defense Operations Research_ (MDOR)
aims to showcase the evolution and current trajectories of OR and
analytics within the context of security. By compiling research
findings, practical applications, and invaluable insights from field
experiences, this book endeavors to illuminate the path for advancing
OR and analytics in addressing contemporary security challenges.

This compilation is brought to life through the collaborative efforts
of esteemed scholars, including co-editor Natalie M. Scala, an
associate professor of business analytics and technology management
at Towson University. Scala's expertise and contributions enrich
the discourse within MDOR, making it an essential resource for
practitioners, researchers, and policymakers keen on exploring the
cutting-edge intersections of OR, analytics, and security strategies.

This book is co-edited with [Natalie M.

   alt="Computational Methods for Numerical Analysis with R book cover" %}

This book offers a comprehensive exploration of numerical analysis,
presenting the subject matter through the lens of R, a highly
regarded programming language known for its powerful statistical
and numerical capabilities. By integrating R into the traditional
numerical analysis course framework, this text modernizes and
enhances the learning experience, making complex mathematical
concepts more accessible and engaging for students.

The structure of the book adheres to the classical curriculum of
numerical analysis, beginning with an in-depth discussion on numerical
error—a foundational aspect of the field that underscores the
importance of accuracy in computational methods. From there, the
narrative progresses logically through key topics such as linear
algebra, interpolation, numerical integration, optimization techniques,
and the numerical solutions of differential equations. This sequence
ensures a thorough coverage of the introductory mathematical concepts
essential for a robust understanding of numerical analysis.

Designed with advanced undergraduates and first-year graduate
students in mind, this text demands a solid grounding in several
core mathematical disciplines. Readers are expected to have a strong
grasp of linear algebra, differential and integral calculus, and
differential equations. The book's content is tailored to students
pursuing mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, and
other disciplines with a significant mathematical component, providing
them with the necessary background to fully comprehend the material.

Moreover, the utilization of R as the primary programming language
not only facilitates a hands-on learning approach but also prepares
students for real-world applications. By the end of this book,
readers will have acquired not only a deep theoretical understanding
of numerical analysis but also practical skills in implementing
numerical methods using R. This dual focus makes the text an
invaluable resource for anyone looking to apply mathematical concepts
in various scientific and engineering contexts.


## Socioeconomic Effects of the National Flood Insurance Program

   alt="Socioeconomic Effects of the National Flood Insurance Program book cover" %}

In this book, I undertake a comprehensive analysis to ascertain the
overall social value of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
over the span from 1996 to 2010. The assessment hinges on a detailed
estimation of the consumer surplus associated with flood insurance,
leveraging historical financial data and survey responses garnered
from the NFIP. Through meticulous evaluation, this study generates
a pivotal statistic that encapsulates the insurance facet of the
NFIP, integrating this finding with additional assessments of the
Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program's advantages to gauge the
cumulative social benefits of these intertwined initiatives.

Furthermore, the analysis is enriched by exploring various income
weighting scenarios, employing a distributionally weighted benefit-cost
approach to assess the programs’ impacts across different socioeconomic
strata. This investigation also delves into the fiscal repercussions
of the NFIP and FMA on government revenue, providing a nuanced
understanding of the economic dynamics at play.

A key feature of this study is the execution of sensitivity analysis
on the obtained results, ensuring robustness and reliability in the
findings. Each segment of the analysis is meticulously detailed,
offering models that can serve as valuable tools for further research.
These models offer a framework for future studies aiming to refine,
expand upon, or adapt the present analysis to other policy programs,
making this book an indispensable resource for policymakers,
researchers, and stakeholders interested in the quantitative
evaluation of public programs.
