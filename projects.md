The [Virtual Bumblbees](/software/virtual-bumblebees) are a simple
cellular automata I created by accident.

## Carme Nearspace Balloon System

The [Carme Nearspace Balloon System](/projects/carme) is my project

[_Danish Language Resources_](/danish-language-resources) is an interactive document
that collects resources for English speakers who are learning the
Danish language.  I started learning
[Danish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language) through
[Duolingo](http://duolingo.com) in December 2014, because DuoLingo
did not have an Icelandic course.  It still doesn't!  But Danish
did a lot to help me read the signs in Iceland.

This document exists to collect resources from around the Internet,
principally YouTube, to help students learning Danish and provide
a catalog for my own use.  Please feel free to suggest additional
material.

[_Swedish Language Resources_](/swedish-language-resources) is an interactive document
that collects resources for English speakers who are learning the
Swedish language. After I finished the Danish language course on
Duolingo, I really wanted to keep my streak up.  I've since lost
the streak, but kept it up at the time by completing the Swedish
language course.  The similarities and differences are quite
interesting between the two languages.

principally YouTube, to help students learning Swedish and provide
a catalog for my own use.
