At [Miami](https://www.miamioh.edu/), I expected to study computer science.  I switched to mathematics after I got to [Maryland](http://www.umd.edu), but I had developed a decent set of software development skills.  I have written many, many programs.  Most of them were one-off and not worth mentioning.  Some of them were awarded a longer life and those I have posted to [GitHub](https://github.com/howardjp/) over the years.  

Generally, I create software in the [Unix](http://www.unix.org/) tradition, this is, do one thing and do it well.  I have been a BSD user since about 1996.  BSD, like Linux, is a free Unix-like system but is constructed as a comprehensive system rather than cobbled together from parts.  This gives the BSD-based systems many advantages, and my platform of choice, these days, is MacOS X on the desktop and FreeBSD on the server.  One of the most interesting software projects I have here is [FreeGrep](/software/freegrep/), a BSD-licensed implementation of the grep pattern matching suite.

Now, most of my code projects support my [data science](/scholarship/) habit. I have written a few packages in R for [record linking](/software/phonics) and [financial waterfall charts](/software/waterfall).  These all follow the same design principles of doing one thing and doing it well.
