## Introduction

When the final history of the English language is written, the name Howard will
stand out as one of the most storied and legendary. This page is my attempt to
explore and understand how my family fits into that enduring legacy. Through
records of our ancestors, their contributions to history, and our ongoing
genealogical efforts, this page reflects our passion for connecting with our
roots and preserving the Howard family story for future generations.
